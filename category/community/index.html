    <p>Instantbird again has the pleasure of participating in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/about_page">Google Summer of Code</a>
under the Mozilla umbrella. In <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2012/04/google-summer-of-code-2012/">the</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2013/05/google-summer-of-code-2013-projects-announced/">past</a> we&#8217;ve had a variety of exciting
projects and this year is no different. Three students will be working with us
this&nbsp;summer:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sawrubh.tumblr.com/">Saurabh Anand</a> (sawrubh), mentored by <a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/">Patrick Cloke</a> (clokep), will aim to
add support for reliable file transfer to Instantbird using <a class="reference external" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/filelink-large-attachments">FileLink</a> as a
fallback to standard file&nbsp;transfer.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://mayanktg.github.io/">Mayank Kumar</a> (mayanktg), mentored by Benedikt P. (Mic), will be adding voice
and video support to Instantbird by integrating <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> for <span class="caps">XMPP</span>. WebRTC makes
it easy for us to have real-time communication without the use of additional&nbsp;plugins.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://nhnt11.com/blog/">Nihanth Subramanya</a> (nhnt11), who last year added the &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2013/07/first-milestone-of-the-awesometab-has-landed/">awesometab</a>&#8220;, will be
looking to improve loading of conversations and history under the guidance of
aleth. He will work on adding the ability to search across all logs of a contact
and loading the previous context of a conversation when scrolling (&#8220;infinite&nbsp;scroll&#8221;).</p>
<p>Please feel free to stop by <a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#instantbird">#instantbird on irc.mozilla.org</a> to say hello and
congratulate our students! Thanks again to Mozilla for allowing us to
participate in Google Summer of Code with&nbsp;them!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For the third year in a row, Instantbird will be participating in Google Summer
of Code. Last year, Will Nayes worked on an <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2012/04/google-summer-of-code-2012/">Account Import Wizard</a> and in 2011,
Varuna Jayasiri worked on our <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/05/status-update-april-2011-may-2011/">JavaScript <span class="caps">XMPP</span> implementation</a> (currently used by
Google Talk and Facebook accounts in Instantbird, as well as Google Talk,
Facebook and <span class="caps">XMPP</span> in&nbsp;Thunderbird).</p>
<p>Instantbird will be mentoring three student projects this&nbsp;year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional JavaScript Protocol Plug-ins&nbsp;(Yahoo!)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this project is to reimplement Yahoo! Messenger support in
Instantbird using JavaScript and <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> interfaces. — <a class="reference external" href="http://phaseshiftsoftware.com/blog/category/gsoc-2013-logs/">Quentin Headen</a>&nbsp;(qheaden)</p>
<p><strong>FileLinks in Instant&nbsp;Messages</strong></p>
<p>The Thunderbird Filelink feature allows users to upload attachments to an
online storage service, replacing the email attachment with a link. This
existing code could be used to implement file transfer. While some protocols
support file transfer directly, this approach would provide a fallback that
should always work. Designing and implementing a good <span class="caps">UI</span> frontend would also
be required. — <a class="reference external" href="http://atuljangra.tumblr.com/">Atul Jangra</a>&nbsp;(atuljangra)</p>
<p><strong>Instantbird&nbsp;Awesometab</strong></p>
<p>I propose to develop a “smart” user interface, in the form of a
user-openable tab, that allows the user to quickly and efficiently open new
chats – based on who they chat with most often, and on what accounts they do
so. The user should be able to go from actively chatting in one conversation
to doing so in a new one, losing no time in finding the contact to start the
conversation with, refocusing to the correct <span class="caps">UI</span> element, or opening extra
windows. — <a class="reference external" href="http://awesometab.blogspot.com/">Nihanth Subramanya</a>&nbsp;(nhnt11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the next few weeks the students are encouraged to bond with their community.
All three have been active in recent weeks on our <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel (#instantbird on
irc.mozilla.org), feel free to stop by and say hello! The Instantbird team looks
forward to working with all of them during the summer. You can check out their
blogs (linked to above) and back here for progress throughout the&nbsp;summer.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank Mozilla for letting us apply to Google Summer of Code as part
of them! You can see the other student projects Mozilla is mentoring on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/mozilla">Google Summer of Code site</a>.</p>

    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://blog.gerv.net/2013/02/summer-of-code-2013/">Mozilla</a> is doing <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode13">Google Summer of Code 2013</a> and
Instantbird is interested in participating again. Instantbird
participated (through Mozilla) the last two years with
<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/05/status-update-april-2011-may-2011/"><span class="caps">JS</span>-<span class="caps">XMPP</span></a> (by varuna in 2011) and the <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2012/04/google-summer-of-code-2012/">Import Wizard</a>
(by wnayes in 2012). Both projects were successful: Instantbird and
Thunderbird use our JavaScript <span class="caps">XMPP</span> code and we&#8217;re hoping to integrate
the Import Wizard into Instantbird soon, after which the <span class="caps">UI</span> could then
be uplifted into&nbsp;Thunderbird.</p>
<p>It is time to start thinking about (and brainstorming) ideas for the
chat in this year&#8217;s GSoC! We&#8217;ve already started
<a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/ib-gsoc-2013">brainstorming</a> and came
up with some ideas, but would love to get more ideas from people.
Remember that a good GSoC project needs to be something that can be
completed by a student in ~8 weeks (but also has to keep a student busy
the whole time!). It should also be something that we would want to
integrate into Instantbird by default and have expected behavior already&nbsp;defined.</p>
<p>Feel free to come chat with us on <span class="caps">IRC</span> (#instantbird on
<a class="reference external" href="http://irc.mozilla.org">irc.mozilla.org</a>) about this or any other&nbsp;topic!</p>

    <p>Instantbird 1.3&nbsp;became&nbsp;available&nbsp;on&nbsp;November, 15,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it comes with new
features (you can see them
clicking&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-all.html">here</a>). The
Instantbird team is interested in offering this <span class="caps">IM</span> client to everyone,
so there&#8217;s a new language in this release: <strong>Brazilian
Portuguese</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>Sim, nós falamos Português!</strong>.&nbsp;Now Brazilians users can
enjoy Instantbird&nbsp;in&nbsp;their&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;Instantbird&nbsp;brought&nbsp;back&nbsp;the <strong>Russian language</strong>&nbsp;in
this release. This language&nbsp;was in&nbsp;Instantbird&nbsp;since version 0.2, but it
was not present&nbsp;in&nbsp;version&nbsp;1.2. Thanks&nbsp;go out&nbsp;to
our&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;localization&nbsp;team for&nbsp;making&nbsp;this&nbsp;possible!</p>
<p>Since the&nbsp;0.2&nbsp;release, Instantbird has&nbsp;been&nbsp;available in 5 languages
-&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Finnish,&nbsp;French,&nbsp;Polish and&nbsp;Russian. The 1.0&nbsp;release
brought&nbsp;six&nbsp;more languages&nbsp;and now&nbsp;Instantbird&nbsp;is&nbsp;available in <strong>13</strong>&nbsp;languages!</p>
<p>The Instantbird team has a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/">goal</a>:&nbsp;&#8220;to
redefine the way instant messaging is used, to work the way you
want.&#8221;&nbsp;To reach this goal, it&#8217;s necessary that Instantbird can be used
by as many&nbsp;people&nbsp;as possible, in every country. So
we&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;interested people to translate it to&nbsp;their&nbsp;languages.&nbsp;If
you&#8217;re interested in helping us achieve this goal by creating
new&nbsp;translations&nbsp;or&nbsp;improving Instantbird, you can get more
information&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/#getinvolved">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Instantbird 1.2 was released about two months ago and we must again
apologize for keeping this blog fairly quiet.&nbsp; Sorry about that!&nbsp; But
we&#8217;re here now, so read on for some (not really so) juicy Instantbird&nbsp;news!</p>
<p>Instantbird 1.2 release went fairly smoothly, much smoother than the
last release!&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten some great feedback (and had lots of bugs
filed) and of course have started working on Instantbird 1.3 already!
Most of the fixes that have so far gone into the 1.3 nightlies so far
are minor&#8230;but taken altogether, I&#8217;m not sure I could go back to 1.2!
Feel free to <a class="reference external" href="http://nightly.instantbird.im/">give them a try</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/">report any issues</a> to&nbsp;us!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 15 was &#8220;recently&#8221; released, which also contained the core
chat backend of Instantbird.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had a bunch of bugs filed from that
release too!&nbsp; Between feedback from the two programs we&#8217;ve made a lot of
minor improvements that will definitely make Instantbird (more of) a joy
to&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Google Summer of Code 2012 has been over for a bit (it ended in August),
but we never thanked Will for his time with us and the great work he&#8217;s
done so far.&nbsp; Currently the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~nayes006/gsoc2012/index.php">account
importer</a> code he
wrote this summer is <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495">undergoing
review</a>, but
hopefully it will be complete for Instantbird 1.3 to allow extremely
easy transitioning to Instantbird!&nbsp; Thanks for a great summer Will!&nbsp; We
hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed working with your mentor, Florian, and the rest of
the Instantbird team; we&#8217;ve definitely enjoyed working with you, helping
you and watching you learn.&nbsp; Good luck and hopefully we&#8217;ll continue to
see you around (and have contributions from you!) in the future.&nbsp; We&#8217;d
also like to thanks Mozilla for graciously allowing us to be part of
Google Summer of Code 2012 through&nbsp;them!</p>
<p>As always, feel free to stop by #instantbird on irc.mozilla.org (and,
yes, Instantbird supports <span class="caps">IRC</span>: you can&#8217;t use the excuse that you don&#8217;t
have an <span class="caps">IRC</span> client!) to give us some feedback or ask&nbsp;questions.</p>

    <p>Instantbird is participating in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) again this
year as part of Mozilla and we will be mentoring one student: Will
Nayes.&nbsp; The abstract for his project&nbsp;is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="rubric" id="instantbird-account-import-wizard"><strong>Instantbird Account Import&nbsp;Wizard</strong></p>
<p>When evaluating a new messaging client, the common frustration of
reconfiguring accounts and settings is difficult to avoid. To combat
similar issues, the developers at Mozilla have implemented account
import wizards in their Firefox and Thunderbird software packages. I
propose creating an Account Import Wizard for the <span class="caps">IM</span> client
Instantbird, which will provide users with a flexible way to import

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This is a question people keep asking us. With some variations (&#8220;Why
should I switch from Adium?&#8221;), or sometimes without the question mark
(&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more than&nbsp;Pidgin&#8221;).</p>
<div class="section" id="we-are-not-competing">
<h2>We are not&nbsp;competing&#8230;</h2>
<p>I think people ask us this question because they perceive us as
competing with Pidgin/Adium/[insert the name of your favorite open
source <span class="caps">IM</span> client]. But there&#8217;s no good answer to that question, because
we are not competing, here is&nbsp;why:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we share values. We believe that instant messaging technologies
should be freely accessible and open: people should not be locked in
closed&nbsp;systems.</li>
<li>we share a technology stand point: we think that to empower people to
increasingly use the open <span class="caps">IM</span> technologies that we like, we need to
offer people a tool that makes it easy to access both promising open
technologies and legacy&nbsp;networks.</li>
<li>we share code. Instantbird, like Adium, relies on libpurple, which is
at the heart of Pidgin, to connect to legacy networks. We take this
code, but we also give back: several changes made to libpurple to
improve its reliability in Instantbird are now part of Pidgin. We are
working together, and Instantbird developers are definitely part of
the Pidgin developer&nbsp;community.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-we-offer-an-alternative">
<h2>&#8230; but we offer an&nbsp;alternative</h2>
<p>I can easily understand why people think we compete though, as we do
provide an alternative. I assume people who ask the previously mentioned
question actually wanted the answer to another question: How is
Instantbird different from Pidgin? Now, this is a question we can&nbsp;answer!</p>
<p>I will actually provide several different answers: the first will
satisfy technically oriented people, the others should be understandable
by everybody. Most of my points compares Instantbird to Pidgin, but are
still applicable when comparing Instantbird to other <span class="caps">IM</span>&nbsp;clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-differences">
<h2>Technical&nbsp;differences</h2>
<p>The biggest technical difference between Pidgin and Instantbird is that
Pidgin uses <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ and Instantbird uses the Mozilla <span class="caps">XUL</span> platform to
display its user&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>The Mozilla platform has advantages compared to <span class="caps">GTK</span>+:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Mozilla platform is well known for its awesome extensibility.
Add-ons can modify almost anything that is part of the Instantbird
user interface, and the skills required to build add-ons are similar
to the skills required to create a website, as the technologies are
basically the same: <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, JavaScript, <span class="caps">XML</span>, &#8230; Instantbird
add-ons are easy to install, some can even be installed without
restarting the application! (To be fair, Pidgin also supports
plugins, but writing them in C requires much more programming
knowledge and to compile them for each platform. Pidgin also has
Python (via D-Bus) and Perl scripting APIs, but I&#8217;m not sure they are
actually usable on&nbsp;Windows.)</li>
<li>While a <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ user interface is native on some Linux desktop operating
systems (typically those based on Gnome or <span class="caps">XFCE</span>), a <span class="caps">XUL</span> user
interface also acts native on Windows (we even included some Aero
Glass effects for Windows 7) and Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X where <span class="caps">GTK</span> may not fit as&nbsp;well.</li>
<li>Thanks to the Mozilla accessibility effort, the <span class="caps">XUL</span> platform is very
accessible and we have received a lot of enthusiastic feedback from
users of assistive technologies who love&nbsp;Instantbird.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing on top of Mozilla also has some (perceived)&nbsp;downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We need to ship the whole Mozilla toolkit, which makes us package
megabytes of compiled code we didn&#8217;t write. This means for example
that the Instantbird installer for Windows weights 9.<span class="caps">9MB</span>. Some people
(especially some Miranda fans) seem to think this is huge, but while
I like to find ways to reduce the size of the installer we ship, I
tend to think at this point it is mostly a non-issue. Just for
comparison, the Pidgin installer weights 9.<span class="caps">5MB</span> without <span class="caps">GTK</span>, and
32.<span class="caps">4MB</span> with all its dependencies&nbsp;included.</li>
<li>The Mozilla platform has the reputation of using more resources than
other browsers/toolkits. The good news is, some bright people are
currently making a <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/MemShrink">huge
effort</a> to reduce
the memory usage, so this will be mitigated in future releases. Plus
the situation is not as bad as some people pretend it to be: the
memory usage measurements we see in comments about Instantbird aren&#8217;t
that scary, some people start to complain when an application uses
<span class="caps">40MB</span> of memory. Hey come on, we are in 2011, new machines have been
shipping with gigabytes of memory for years&nbsp;already&#8230;</li>
<li>I heard from some Linux packagers that the Mozilla build system is
not easy to work with for them. While there may be some pain points
here, it doesn&#8217;t really affect the end&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-make-instantbird-for-you">
<h2>We make Instantbird for&nbsp;you!</h2>
<p>Some developers make their programs the best for themselves and share it
with you, for free. These programs are the result of people&#8217;s hard work
which they offer you as a gift, and so these people deserve respect for
that! Unfortunately, it is not unusual that if somehow the product
doesn&#8217;t work out for you, it&#8217;s your problem, not theirs, and you are
free: to fix it, to report the issue and hope someone will fix it, or to
look for a greener pasture. Your comments are valued if they help
developers make their program better for everybody, for example if it
helps fixing bugs that lots of people suffer from. Your opinions and
wishes may not be taken into account, however, unless you intend to
actually start working on them: patches are welcome, not additional work
(people are busy&nbsp;already).</p>
<p>We work to make Instantbird the best for you. We look forward to
gathering your feedback and acting upon it to make Instantbird even
better, for you. We assume that when someone takes the trouble to come
and talk with us to complain about something, there&#8217;s a valid concern.
Even when it&#8217;s well hidden behind factually inexact assertions that we
can&#8217;t agree with. If people cannot express themselves clearly, there&#8217;s a
reason why they are confused, and if a confusion is common, we should
find its cause and fix&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>As this difference may be a bit theoretical, I&#8217;m going to give a
concrete example in the next point: the way we deal with stability&nbsp;issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stability">
<h2>Stability</h2>
<div class="section" id="crash-reports">
<h3>Crash&nbsp;reports</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens in the unfortunate event of the user being hit by
a bug resulting in a crash of the&nbsp;application:</p>
<p>If you are using Pidgin and want to help get the bug fixed, you need to
<a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/GetABacktrace">get a backtrace</a> (on
Unix systems) or to have <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/TipsForBugReports#WhattodoifPidgincrashes">installed the debug symbols before the
crash</a>
so that a crash report could be dumped to the disk (on Windows). Then
you need to open a ticket on trac and give all the info you have. As
this process may be a bit scary for most end-users, I&#8217;m afraid valuable
feedback could get&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>If the same issue happens with Instantbird, first we&nbsp;apologize:</p>
<p><img alt="Instantbird crash reporter" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/crash-breakpad.png" /></p>
<p>Then all you have to do to send us the technical information about the
crash is a single click in this crash reporter dialog. We collect all
these crash reports and analyze them to improve the stability of the
next version of&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nightly-testing">
<h3>Nightly&nbsp;testing</h3>
<p>In addition to collecting crash reports, another thing we do to maintain
a high stability level for Instantbird is that we encourage early
adopters to run with nightly builds of Instantbird which are updated
almost daily with the very latest version of our source code. Therefore,
if something we changed degrades the stability, we receive crash reports
way before the defective change ends up in a release you may&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>If some change feels a bit risky to us, we push it to our testers at
least a week before releasing, or we delay it so that it gets
appropriate testing before being included in the next&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>Just as a comparison, Pidgin&#8217;s currently in development code is tested
only by developers and <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Installing%20Pidgin#WhydoyoualwayssaynottouseMTN">others people are discouraged from attempting to
use
it</a>.</p>
<p>Learn more about our <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2010/07/stability/">stability efforts</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changing">
<h2>Changing</h2>
<p>We keep seeing comments of people (who have not actually tried
Instantbird) who think we should go improve Pidgin instead of &#8220;wasting
time&#8221; on&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
<p>In the page of our website where we explain <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/">why we create
Instantbird</a>, we&nbsp;conclude:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="compound">
<p>It&#8217;s time to bring back&nbsp;innovation!</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>To do this, we need to be able to change things easily. As Instantbird
is still a young project, we can change&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>Pidgin on the other hand is already a mature project with policies about
when it&#8217;s acceptable to change APIs or when they are frozen: it&#8217;s
basically impossible to change an <span class="caps">API</span> in Pidgin until a new major
version is released (so after the Pidgin 2.0.0 release, the <span class="caps">API</span> changes
have to wait until Pidgin 3.0.0 comes out to be included: currently
Pidgin 2.0.0 was released over four years ago!). This is a good thing to
ensure the plugins stay compatible, but it slows down the changes to the&nbsp;application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="different-feature-sets">
<h2>Different feature&nbsp;sets</h2>
<p>This is my last point even though most people would expect to see it
first. Instantbird and Pidgin have different feature&nbsp;sets.</p>
<p>On one hand, Pidgin has some features that Instantbird doesn&#8217;t have.
Some that we will have in the future. Some that we don&#8217;t want to have.
I&#8217;m not going to give a full list here because I don&#8217;t actually have a
list of all Pidgin features to compare and check what we have and what
we don&#8217;t have. We are neither trying to copy Pidgin nor to directly
compete against it, so such a list would be irrelevant&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Instantbird has some features that Pidgin doesn&#8217;t
have (message themes, automatic updates, inline search, &#8230;) and even
some unique features (for two examples, see my blog posts introducing
<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/06/introducing-time-bubbles/">Time Bubbles</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/06/introducing-magic-copy/">Magic copy</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, should you switch to Instantbird? If I were you, I would. But I&#8217;m
not you. Deciding which <span class="caps">IM</span> client you use is your choice, based on your
taste, your needs, your feelings. It&#8217;s your decision,&nbsp;really!</p>
<p>If you like what you currently have and see nothing you like in what
Instantbird offers, just keep using what you&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>If you love Instantbird, then, obviously you should use&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If you are in the middle and like Instantbird but for some reason can&#8217;t
use it because something you really need is missing or doesn&#8217;t work,
please tell us about it, we are eager to receive your feedback! And
maybe there&#8217;s already an add-on to customize Instantbird to do what you
wanted that we can point you&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>In any case, we are not going to try to force you to switch from Pidgin
or whatever <span class="caps">IM</span> client you may be using right now to Instantbird. We
respect your freedom, we respect your choices, we love&nbsp;you!</p>
