As
every time I went to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt;, it was great to meet again several
Mozillians I hadn&amp;#8217;t seen for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk early on Sunday morning about Instantbird. I would like to
thank all the people who attended the session, asked interesting
questions and gave great feedback at the end of the talk and during the
rest of the day: thank&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who would have liked to be there but couldn&amp;#8217;t because
of the time (too early, especially after the great dinner and bowling
event Saturday evening) or location (not everybody lives in Europe!), I
put the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/files/fosdem11-slides/"&gt;slides of my presentation&lt;/a&gt; online (and even wrote down what I&amp;nbsp;said!).&lt;/p&gt;
