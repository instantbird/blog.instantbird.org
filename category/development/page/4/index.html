  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As you may already know, Instantbird 0.2 will be released soon. The
development of this version has been going on for more than a year
already! While we have been busy adding new features or polishing
existing ones, we may have missed a few opportunities to communicate
about what we were doing, what we had already done, where we are going,
and why. And when we did write something about our new features, the
announcements lacked screenshots, and probably didn&#8217;t convey much of our&nbsp;enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The last few days before the 0.2 release are an opportunity for us make
up for our lack of&nbsp;communication.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-way-toward-instantbird-1-0">
<h2>The way toward Instantbird&nbsp;1.0</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a clarification about the way we are slowly but surely
going to our future 1.0 release. Our <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Initial_Roadmap">initial
roadmap</a>
contained the somewhat misleading claim that our goal for 1.0 was to
reach &#8220;feature parity&#8221; with <a class="reference external" href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>. This led
some people to believe that we were basically copying the Pidgin
graphical user interface and reimplementing it in <span class="caps">XUL</span>. Although this
could have held some truth for the earlier goal of Instantbird - which
was to provide the extensibility that is loved in Firefox and features
similar to those found in Pidgin - this is no longer the&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>When we implement a new feature in Instantbird, we carefully consider
how it is likely to be used. We think about the use cases. We look at
how the same problem has been handled by other existing <span class="caps">IM</span> clients, so
that we can benefit from what others have done before us. Sometimes we
take inspiration and implement something in a similar way to another
client (for instance the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Message_Styles_reference">message theme
system</a>
that we have borrowed from <a class="reference external" href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>), but sometimes
things don&#8217;t look satisfying and we have to look for a better solution.
We especially try to avoid exposing the user to new popup dialogs that
interrupt the user but don&#8217;t seem absolutely&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>Once something is implemented, we do our best to take advantage of the
early feedback we get from our <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/articles/nightly-builds-available.rst">nightly</a>&nbsp;testers.</p>
<p>So why are we doing this? Copying the interface of an existing
application as quickly as possible would be easier, and would lead to a
fast result. But it would be worthless. We don&#8217;t need another Pidgin,
Adium, &#8230; (insert the name of your favorite multi-protocol <span class="caps">IM</span>
application here). These applications already exist and are mostly
great, there&#8217;s no point in cloning them. What we do care about is our
users: our current users of course, but also future users. We believe
instant messaging should be less frustrating. We want to build an
all-in-one instant messaging application that is as easy as possible to
use, yet powerful. We value simplicity and ease of use in the default
configuration, and at the same time we want to allow advanced
customizations. Developers with an idea should be able to easily
customize their <span class="caps">IM</span> client, like they can already do with their web&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>We value privacy, and respect your data. Instant messages often have
confidential or intimate content. We believe that our users should have
the power to decide how this information is used, and where it is
stored. This is the reason why even though more and more users decide to
use web applications like Gmail, Facebook or Meebo for their <span class="caps">IM</span> needs,
we believe that it is still relevant in 2010 to build an <span class="caps">IM</span> application
that runs directly on the computer you&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know yet how Instantbird 1.0 will be, it will need to be
discussed. With You. At this point we are discussing which improvements
will compose the 0.3 release. If you want to take part in this
discussion or have questions related to our long term goals, don&#8217;t
hesitate to <a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/contact.html">get in touch</a> with&nbsp;us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What&#8217;s&nbsp;next?</h2>
<p>We are confident that if you have tried a release from the Instantbird
0.1.* series, you will see Instantbird 0.2 as major improvement. And if
you haven&#8217;t used Instantbird before, then the 0.2 release is a great
time to start! In the next few days, we will detail a few of the
features that already make Instantbird 0.2 a very usable instant
messaging application, despite its low version&nbsp;number.</p>

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The last status update here was more than a month ago, so it&#8217;s probably
time for another update. We are still working toward releasing
Instantbird 0.2 in the near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>At this point, the code of the application is ready. Two points are
still holding the release&nbsp;though:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we have to rework the server side part of our update system, because
the scripts we used on the server up to version 0.2b2 of Instantbird
were not able to handle updates in several languages. We want to be
sure that users who downloaded Instantbird 0.2 beta 2 in a
non-English language will receive an updated version in the same&nbsp;language.</li>
<li>we are redesigning the main website of Instantbird. The goal of this
redesign is partly to provide a visual refresh, but also to clarify
the message. We are de-emphasizing the &#8220;multi-platform&#8221; argument (it
is probably irrelevant to most users and is probably quickly
understood by those who care about using Instantbird on more than one
operating system), and we try to emphasis the simplicity and ease of
use of&nbsp;Instantbird.</li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to putting Instantbird 0.2 in the hands of users who
didn&#8217;t dare to try the beta&nbsp;releases.</p>

    <p>We have been contacted by lots of individuals who volunteered to
translate Instantbird into their native language and were eager to start
working on it. As we were not ready to host the translations, we asked
people to wait before starting their work on localized versions of&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
<p>As we plan to release the next beta of Instantbird 0.2 in several
languages, we feel that now is a good time to start translating the <span class="caps">UI</span>
of Instantbird. Please note that the development work is not finished
yet, and that there will still be string changes before we are ready to
release this next&nbsp;milestone.</p>

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In our <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Roadmap">roadmap</a> we
stated that for 0.2 we were going to improve the conversation window,
and especially make it customizable. Let&#8217;s show you an overview of what
we&nbsp;did.</p>
<div class="section" id="smileys">
<h2>Smileys</h2>
<p>People are used to see little images like <img alt=":-)" src="http://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/sourire.png" /> in conversations instead
of the plain text version <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:-)</span></tt>. Testers of Instantbird 0.1.* have
probably noticed that this feature was missing. No&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Instantbird 0.2 supports smileys, and has a theme system for them.
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Creating_a_smiley_theme">Creating a new smiley
theme</a>
is easy: it is just a bunch of images and a file (<span class="caps">JSON</span> format)
describing how to use them, bundled into an <span class="caps">XPI</span>&nbsp;file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="message-styles">
<h2>Message&nbsp;styles</h2>
<p>Selecting a smiley theme is not enough for you to feel comfortable when
looking at your conversations? Ok, we have more! We have borrowed the
message style system of Adium to let you fully customize the way your
conversations&nbsp;look.</p>
<p>An image is worth a thousand words so&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna give you a <a class="reference external" href="http://screenshots.instantbird.org/message-styles-preview/">thousand
of
images</a>.
Ok, not really a thousand, but we took a few hundreds of screenshots to
show how Instantbird is doing with the hundreds of Adium message styles
downloadable from
<a class="reference external" href="http://adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=search&amp;cat_id=5">adiumxtra.com</a>.</p>
<p>The compatibility is not perfect because there are some <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Message_Styles:Differences_with_Adium">differences in
the way Instantbird and Adium handle
themes</a>,
and some Adium themes may use some webkit-specific features, but most
themes look&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>This theme system is very flexible, and quite easy to learn. The
technologies used (<span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, JavaScript) are well known by
web-developers and web-designers. If you are not happy with the existing
themes, go ahead an create your own. And don&#8217;t hesitate to let your
creativity play with all the cool <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Firefox_3.5_for_developers">new developer features of Firefox
3.5</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extensibility">
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>The eye candy is cool but&#8230; I&#8217;m a developer, I want to create
extensions and I want to be able to interact with the conversations!
Don&#8217;t worry, we love you too. We added several new APIs for extension
developers. It is now easy, for example, to change the way we filter
incoming messages, modify the text before it is displayed (adding links
for instance), and more&nbsp;coming!</p>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2009/07/instantbird-0-2-feature-preview-localizability/" rel="bookmark">Instantbird 0.2 Feature Preview:&nbsp;Localizability</a></h1>
  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As you may (or may not) know, we previously wrote that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/about_translations.html">Instantbird
0.1.* was not
localizable</a>. The
reason evoked for this was the use of gettext by libpurple, which is not
compatible with the way <span class="caps">XUL</span> applications are localized. I&#8217;m going to
give more details about the issue, and explain how we solved it for
Instantbird&nbsp;0.2.</p>
<div class="section" id="comparison-of-translation-systems-used-by-mozilla-and-libpurple">
<h2>Comparison of translation systems used by Mozilla and&nbsp;libpurple:</h2>
<p>Inside libpurple, localizable strings are just marked by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_(&quot;string&quot;)</span></tt>.
For example, you can find
<a class="reference external" href="http://lxr.instantbird.org/instantbird/source/purple/libpurple/connection.c#549">this</a>
in the&nbsp;code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
description = _(&quot;Unknown error&quot;);
</pre>
<p>During the compilation, _() is expanded by the C preprocessor to a call
to a gettext function. Gettext tools can analyze the source code, find
all strings enclosed in _() markers, and produce a translation
template. <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/l10n/pidgin.pot">This template</a>
(a .pot file) is then handed to translators, who translate the strings
and then provide a .po file for their&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>The translation system for <span class="caps">XUL</span> applications is quite different, here are
2 significant&nbsp;differences:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>localizable strings are not directly in the source code. The source
code uses unique identifiers, and these identifiers are used to find
the actual string in the locale&nbsp;files.</li>
<li>the strings are spread across several localized files. Usually each
window has its separate files, which makes it easy to decide at a
later point that something will become an extension, and makes it
easy to localize an extension like any other part of the&nbsp;application.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-we-deal-with-this-in-instantbird">
<h2>How do we deal with this in&nbsp;Instantbird?</h2>
<p>Obviously, we don&#8217;t want Instantbird to use both of these localization
systems, so one had to be removed. In Instantbird 0.1.*, we just
removed gettext without replacing it. This means that the gettext _()
macro was defined to something doing nothing, and the string used was
just the one specified directly inside the source&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>For Instantbird 0.2, this is no longer acceptable, and we worked on a
way to simulate the action of gettext, that is, hiding the 2 differences
I&#8217;ve just&nbsp;explained.</p>
<p>Splitting the translation in different files wasn&#8217;t very difficult.
Actually, gettext has a concept of packages that makes it possible to
split the translation of an application into several packages, the
feature is just unused by libpurple. With a little bit of build system
tweaking, I finally got a translation file for the core of libpurple,
and a separate translation file for each protocol plugin. This was
needed so that <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/articles/instantbird-0-2-feature-preview-protocols-as-extensions-2.rst">libpurple protocol plugins packaged as extensions</a>
can be&nbsp;localized.</p>
<p>Creating a unique identifier for each localizable string was a bit more
work. The solution we have settled on&nbsp;is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Take the original string and remove all string formatters (words
starting with %), hexadecimal numbers (words starting with 0x) and
more generally, all non alphanumeric&nbsp;characters.</li>
<li>Remove all the whitespace in the remaining string, keep only the 7
first words, and convert to camel&nbsp;case.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we have an identifier for the original string, but it is
not unique. Long strings that differ only at the end result in the same
identifier, and strings that don&#8217;t contain any real word (&#8216;%s:%s&#8217; for
instance) all result in an empty string. To disambiguate in these cases,
and only in these cases, we append the 8 first characters of the
hexadecimal <span class="caps">MD5</span> hash of the original string to the&nbsp;identifier.</p>
<div class="section" id="now-how-do-we-use-this">
<h3>Now, how do we use&nbsp;this?</h3>
<p>We have a .properties file for libpurple and one for each protocol
plugin. When libpurple is compiled for Instantbird, the gettext macros
are modified to point to some of our code instead of the gettext
library. Our code uses the en-<span class="caps">US</span> string to build the identifier, and
attempts to find it in the .properties file. If it isn&#8217;t found, it tries
again with the identifier plus the 8 first characters of the <span class="caps">MD5</span> hash of
the string. If it still isn&#8217;t found, then it returns the en-<span class="caps">US</span> string as
a fallback (and emits a warning in debug&nbsp;builds).</p>

<div class="section" id="how-do-we-make-the-properties-files-for-libpurple">
<h3>How do we make the .properties files for&nbsp;libpurple?</h3>
<p>I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://hg.instantbird.org/instantbird/file/b288fc7228e7/tools/l10n/convert-purple-po-files-to-properties-files.py">a python
script</a>
that generates automatically the appropriate .properties files for the
en-<span class="caps">US</span> language from the source code of libpurple. Additionnaly, it uses
the various .po files of Pidgin to produce files that can be used as a
base for localizing this part of&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>

<div class="section" id="does-this-mean-i-can-start-translating-instantbird-into-my-own-language">
<h3>Does this mean I can start translating Instantbird into my own&nbsp;language?</h3>
<p>No, not yet, but very soon! Once we are ready to accept contributions
from translators, we will ask translators who volunteer to localize
Instantbird to contact us so that we can provide them with these
generated&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>An alpha build of Instantbird 0.2 will be available soon. We will
provide an experimental French translation of this build (most people in
our team are French, so French was the logical choice for testing all of
this&nbsp;ourselves).</p>

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the features we wanted in Instantbird 0.2 was the ability to
install libpurple protocol plugins like any other addon. I&#8217;m happy to
report that this is now possible with current <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.instantbird.com/instantbird/nightly/latest-trunk/">nightly
builds</a>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this feature, I compiled the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-facebookchat/">Facebook Chat libpurple
protocol plugin</a>. The
result is an <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/files/facebook.xpi">installable xpi file</a> of about 200kB,
that people can try with nightly builds of&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
<p>This file contains a binary module compiled for Windows, Linux and Mac
<span class="caps">OS</span> X (universal), produced by copying the code from
<a class="reference external" href="http://pidgin-facebookchat.googlecode.com/files/pidgin-facebookchat-source-1.47.tar.bz2">here</a>
into the Instantbird source tree. This is the quickest way I found to
build it, we will need to figure out a better (without having to
download and build the whole Instantbird source code) way later. This is
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/files/add-facebook-chat-prpl.patch">the exact patch I used</a> to build&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The xpi file also contains a set of icons and a locale file. I will
explain in another post how we replaced the usage of <tt class="docutils literal">gettext</tt> in
libpurple by a way to get localized strings from regular .properties&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>Feel free to try this facebook chat addons. I don&#8217;t know how stable it
is, but I&#8217;ve used it for a few days already and haven&#8217;t encountered any
serious issue. If this turns out to be crashy for you, don&#8217;t hesitate to
send us crash reports, I uploaded the symbols to our symbol servers, so
the reports should provide useful&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>I have other nearly-ready Instantbird 0.2 features to introduce in more
details later, including: localization, emoticon themes, message styles
(like Adium),&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>Next time: how localization works with Instantbird and how we replaced
<tt class="docutils literal">gettext</tt>.</p>
