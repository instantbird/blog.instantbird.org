There are a ton of
new features and bugs fixed for this new release, but we’d like to highlight a
couple of new features&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/awesometab.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="awesometab" class="alignright size-full" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/awesometab-300x217.png" style="width: 300px; height: 217px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exciting new feature you’ll find in Instantbird 1.5 is the New Conversation
tab. It displays a list of your contacts, ordered based on how frequently and
recently you’ve talked to them. Starting a conversation has never been easier!
No longer will you have to open a separate window and scroll through your
contact list to find a person. Just click the “+” button or press Ctrl/Cmd+T,
start typing the name of the contact, and you should see your contact appear at
the top of the list after typing only a few letters! You can then press enter
and your conversation opens! The first time you open the tab, Instantbird will
load your chat logs and learn who you talk to most often in order to offer
accurate suggestions. New friends might not show up at the top immediately, but
keep talking to them and they’ll reorder themselves. Don’t worry though, this
ranking data is kept only on your own computer and is not transmitted or shared
in any&amp;nbsp;way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you use Instantbird for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;, the New Conversation tab will
automatically query your servers to download the list of channels that are
available to you. (This is generally known as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIST&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; jargon.) Just like
with your contacts, you can type in the name of a channel and it’ll bubble to
the top of the list. Sometimes you don’t always know the channel name (that’s
why you’re searching, right?): we’ve got you covered there too! Instantbird will
search the channel topics in addition to channel names so you can quickly find
new channels to&amp;nbsp;join!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/new-tooltips-300x101.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="new-tooltips" class="alignleft size-full" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/new-tooltips-300x101.png" style="width: 300px; height: 101px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very visible user interface improvement that was included for Instantbird 1.5
is redone tooltips that fit more into the visual style of the rest of the user
interface. They should be immediately familiar to Instantbird users as they’re
modeled after the conversation header! Hopefully this will help you find
information quickly and easily whether conversing with your contacts or just
checking their&amp;nbsp;status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Linux users out there, we are still only offering 32-bit builds, although we
hope to change that soon! If you are running a 64-bit Linux distribution,
previously you’d have to install the ia32-libs (see our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;), but this has
changed in recent versions of Ubuntu which no longer offer this package. The
procedure now is to&amp;nbsp;run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386 libpangox-1.0-0:i386 libpangoxft-1.0-0:i386 libidn11:i386 libglu1-mesa:i386 libxt-dev:i386 libasound-dev:i386
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-all.html"&gt;Get your copy&lt;/a&gt; of
Instantbird 1.4, hot off the presses! We&amp;#8217;ve made a lot of improvements
(for full details, see the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/release-notes.html"&gt;release
notes&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character counter should now be correct when tweeting&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter now uses the v1.1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, this will allow Twitter to continue
working past June 11th, 2013 (when the v1.0 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;disabled).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invalid/self-signed/out-of-date &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certificates can now be easily
overridden for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logs are now organized by the date they were created, and smartly folded
to easily find recent&amp;nbsp;chats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stated during the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2012/11/instantbird-1-3-released/"&gt;Instantbird 1.3 release&lt;/a&gt;, this version now requires
Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Instantbird 1.4 is based off Mozilla 20 and
libpurple 2.10.7, the newest versions&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be asking &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s next?&amp;#8221; for Instantbird; we will be
participating in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode13#Instantbird"&gt;Google Summer of Code
2013&lt;/a&gt;
(again through Mozilla). Through this and our other volunteers, we&amp;#8217;ll
continue improving Instantbird to make it a chat program you love to
use. Hopefully we can integrate some cool new features from this year&amp;#8217;s
Google Summer of Code and finish integrating the Account Import Wizard
from Google Summer of Code 2012! As always, if you see any issues,
please &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org"&gt;file bugs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

any mathematics contained in your conversations will be beautifully
rendered using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathjax.org"&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="alignright size-full" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/math21.png" style="width: 445px; height: 377px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rather nice to be able to discuss math using familiar
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; markup, but with the
equations displayed properly. And of course, as LaTeX is text-based,
this works for all protocols, and does not depend on your conversation
partners also using&amp;nbsp;Instantbird!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No configuration is necessary &amp;#8212; to use this, you don&amp;#8217;t even need to
have TeX&amp;nbsp;installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily obtain the LaTeX source of any equation using the context
menu. AMSmath symbols and environments (such as
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;\\begin{align}...\\end{align}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) are&amp;nbsp;supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few customization options &amp;#8212; for example, you can choose to
have displayed equations numbered automatically, to make them easier to
refer&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The add-on works with all Instantbird message styles, so you don&amp;#8217;t have
to change your favourite&amp;nbsp;theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/340/"&gt;Get the add-on&amp;nbsp;here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-all.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)!&amp;nbsp; This update
includes some nice improvements, which are fully outlined in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/release-notes.html"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; A
few changes of note&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Show-Nick.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-medium alignright" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Show-Nick-300x281.png" style="width: 300px; height: 281px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Long messages will now be sent in multiple parts, and more
authentication methods are supported to connect e.g. to&amp;nbsp;Freenode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt; Replying to a tweet now replies to all users, just like
on the Twitter&amp;nbsp;website!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;nicknames are now highlighted&lt;/strong&gt; when mentioned in a&amp;nbsp;chat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two new social networks were added: &lt;strong&gt;Odnoklassniki&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;VKontakte&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various connection issues with Twitter and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMPP&lt;/span&gt; based networks were&amp;nbsp;fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility&amp;nbsp;improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this will be the last release to support Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; 10.5 and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPC&lt;/span&gt;, as we will be unable to support these once we upgrade Instantbird
to Mozilla&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve got plenty of interesting new features and ideas for upcoming
versions of Instantbird!&amp;nbsp; We will update to a more recent version of
Mozilla with awesome new features, imagine all the cool things we can do
with technologies like&amp;nbsp;WebRTC!&lt;/p&gt;

improvements!&amp;nbsp; If you love Instantbird 1.1, you&amp;#8217;ll definitely appreciate
the improvements made in this release; and if you don&amp;#8217;t use Instantbird
yet&amp;#8230;well I&amp;#8217;d suggest you &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-all.html"&gt;give it a
try&lt;/a&gt;! You can read the
full list of changes (403 to be precise) in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/release-notes.html"&gt;release
notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantbird 1.2 took way more time to finish (10 months!) than we
originally expected, and even though there&amp;#8217;s a very long list of
improved details, there&amp;#8217;s no major new features. So you may wonder&amp;#8230;
what&amp;nbsp;happened?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the reason why it took so long is&amp;#8230;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;! The major
change that came with Instantbird 1.2 is that the chat back-end code is
now shared with Thunderbird, that will feature instant messaging support
in its version 15, to be released in a few&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forced us to give priority to some long standing side projects that
were interesting for Instantbird, but not immediately required: as
Thunderbird can&amp;#8217;t use libpurple which has an incompatible license, we
had to finish sooner, rather than later, some major architectural
changes to ensure that our chat back-end doesn&amp;#8217;t depend on libpurple at
all. That&amp;#8217;s right, Instantbird 1.2 is no longer based on libpurple (but
still uses it to support many protocols of&amp;nbsp;course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our back-end working without libpurple wasn&amp;#8217;t enough for Thunderbird:
the only protocol plug-in shipped in Instantbird 1.0 and 1.1 that didn&amp;#8217;t
use libpurple was Twitter; more were obviously needed. Fortunately, we
were already cooking a JavaScript implementation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMPP&lt;/span&gt; (started during
Google Summer of Code 2011) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; (it&amp;#8217;s been Patrick&amp;#8217;s side project
for years!). Our initial goal when we started working on these 2
protocol reimplementations in JavaScript was to gain full control of the
way these important protocols are handled by Instantbird, and to improve
their extensibility. For Thunderbird, finishing them became a priority,
and it&amp;#8217;s where we spent most of our&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#8217;m talking a lot about Thunderbird, you may be wondering if this
involvement of the Instantbird team in the Thunderbird project could
mean we are discontinuing the development of Instantbird as a
stand-alone application. Not at all! We believe both applications
complement each other very well, and have different use cases. While
Thunderbird, with integrated email and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt;, may be better for users who
work all day long with their email client and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; the same contacts; we
believe lots of home users tend to use a webmail instead of a local
email client and would prefer to keep their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; application&amp;nbsp;separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re very excited that Instantbird is developing closer ties with
Mozilla, who we think shares a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.en.html"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; of allowing
users, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;, to control their own privacy on the Internet! A few of our
developers are now &amp;#8220;peers&amp;#8221; of Mozilla&amp;#8217;s new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Chat"&gt;chat
module&lt;/a&gt;, and we are pursuing
more opportunities to bring Instantbird closer to Mozilla in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you&amp;#8217;ll enjoy using Instantbird 1.2 as much as we are and we
greatly look forward to the next version of Instantbird! As always, if
you see any bugs please &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org"&gt;file a
bug&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#instantbird"&gt;catch us on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:contact&amp;#64;instantbird.org"&gt;email
us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">clokep</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2012 14:31:41 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.instantbird.org,2012-08-08:/2012/08/instantbird-1-2-released/</guid><category>Downloads</category><category>1.2</category><category>announce</category><category>downloads</category></item><item><title>Instantbird 1.1 released!</title><link>https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/10/instantbird-1-1-released/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Exactly 4 years after the very early 0.1 preview, Instantbird 1.1 has
just been released today in 13 locales (Swedish and Estonian are&amp;nbsp;new)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to several stability fixes and a dramatic reduction of
resource consumption in some cases, this new release will make Twitter
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; much more usable in&amp;nbsp;Instantbird:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Twitter, it&amp;#8217;s now possible from the context menu to &lt;strong&gt;retweet&lt;/strong&gt;,
to &lt;strong&gt;reply to a tweet&lt;/strong&gt; (or simply double click on the tweet to start
a reply). The context menu also lets you follow or unfollow the
author of the&amp;nbsp;tweet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tab completion&lt;/strong&gt; of usernames (starting with an &amp;#64; character on
twitter) or nicknames (in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; channels) will also be very&amp;nbsp;appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these changes have been commonly requested, so no surprise here. But
there&amp;#8217;s one last feature I would like to talk about before offering you
a download link: Instantbird 1.1 brings support for putting conversation
on hold. This means you can now &lt;strong&gt;close conversation tabs without
leaving the conversation&lt;/strong&gt;, the conversation will sit at the top of the
Contacts window until you reopen it or someone talks to you. While this
may seem like a small change, it&amp;#8217;s exceptionally useful for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; users
who tend to idle in lots of channels because they want to &amp;#8220;be there just
in case&amp;#8221; but don&amp;#8217;t interact much with the&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough talk! Time to go &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/"&gt;download Instantbird
1.1&lt;/a&gt; (or read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/release-notes.html"&gt;more detailed release
notes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, your feedback is welcome! And if you like Instantbird, maybe
you will want to share the good news with your friends on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.instantbird.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Servers&amp;nbsp;load&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantbird 1.0 has been very quickly downloaded over ten thousand of
times. In fact, it happened so fast (especially immediately after we
have been &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/5816618/instantbird-is-a-lightweight-cross+platform-instant-messaging-app-with-sharp-looks"&gt;featured on
lifehacker&lt;/a&gt;)
that our server couldn&amp;#8217;t handle the&amp;nbsp;load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have very quickly been able to mirror our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/"&gt;main
website&lt;/a&gt; on another server, which
allowed people to keep discovering and downloading Instantbird 1.0, but
we had to close the add-ons website for a while as the load it couldn&amp;#8217;t
handle was also putting down other services that we really needed to
keep online, especially our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/"&gt;bug
database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tried to re-open the add-ons website at a quieter time, but the
server was unresponsive again within half an hour. This morning we tried
to improve the website&amp;#8217;s performance by adding some caching mechanism
and reopened again (at a time when most Americans are asleep) for a try.
Again it fall&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people very kindly offered help and proposed to host the website on
their server, but it&amp;#8217;s difficult to trust someone we barely know to host
a website that requires our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the add-ons website had been closed for almost 2 days already (sorry
for the inconvenience!) and extensibility is a key differentiator of
Instantbird compared to other similar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; clients, we decided that this
situation couldn&amp;#8217;t last any longer and we solved the problem by throwing
money at it: we ordered a beefier server (Quad Core &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;)
and migrated the add-ons website to it as quickly as we could. The
website reopened this afternoon, and our testing confirmed that the new
server can easily handle the load, even with more visitors than we had
when the previous server stopped responding. It&amp;#8217;s ready for a lot more
people coming! Don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to tell your friends to try Instantbird

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="feedback"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have received a massive amount of feedback since the release. Most
was positive or extremely positive. We received lots of encouragements.
We even received some love&amp;nbsp;letters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the feedback showed there was some confusion, for example about
how we are different from Pidgin (which we will be the subject of
another post to clarify things). We also received constructive
criticism, good bug reports. The most common request is an easy way to
retweet or to reply to a tweet. We will work on that soon &lt;img alt=":)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/sourire.png" /&gt;. Tab
completion of nick names is also commonly requested, but even though
it&amp;#8217;s clear we need to have this by default in the future, we can usually
satisfy the reporter by pointing to the great (restartless!) &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/276"&gt;Tab
Complete&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="updates"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As no alarming issue has been reported in Instantbird 1.0 which is
already widely used, we have decided to turn on major updates from
Instantbird 0.2 to Instantbird&amp;nbsp;1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of Instantbird 0.2 will be offered an update shortly with an
update prompt looking like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dialog offering a major update to Instantbird 1.0" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/major-update-1.0.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of our 0.3pre nightly builds will be offered an update to a
nightly build numbered 1.1a1pre in the next few&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&amp;#8217;s been a great release and the last few days have been
exciting (even though they were also exhausting). We look forward to
continue hearing your feedback (and to actually act upon it!). Don&amp;#8217;t
hesitate to share Instantbird with your friends. Our servers are&amp;nbsp;ready!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
