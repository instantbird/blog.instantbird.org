apologize for keeping this blog fairly quiet.&amp;nbsp; Sorry about that!&amp;nbsp; But
we&amp;#8217;re here now, so read on for some (not really so) juicy Instantbird&amp;nbsp;news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantbird 1.2 release went fairly smoothly, much smoother than the
last release!&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve gotten some great feedback (and had lots of bugs
filed) and of course have started working on Instantbird 1.3 already!
Most of the fixes that have so far gone into the 1.3 nightlies so far
are minor&amp;#8230;but taken altogether, I&amp;#8217;m not sure I could go back to 1.2!
Feel free to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nightly.instantbird.im/"&gt;give them a try&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/"&gt;report any issues&lt;/a&gt; to&amp;nbsp;us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird 15 was &amp;#8220;recently&amp;#8221; released, which also contained the core
chat backend of Instantbird.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve had a bunch of bugs filed from that
release too!&amp;nbsp; Between feedback from the two programs we&amp;#8217;ve made a lot of
minor improvements that will definitely make Instantbird (more of) a joy
to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code 2012 has been over for a bit (it ended in August),
but we never thanked Will for his time with us and the great work he&amp;#8217;s
done so far.&amp;nbsp; Currently the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~nayes006/gsoc2012/index.php"&gt;account
importer&lt;/a&gt; code he
wrote this summer is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495"&gt;undergoing
review&lt;/a&gt;, but
hopefully it will be complete for Instantbird 1.3 to allow extremely
easy transitioning to Instantbird!&amp;nbsp; Thanks for a great summer Will!&amp;nbsp; We
hope you&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed working with your mentor, Florian, and the rest of
the Instantbird team; we&amp;#8217;ve definitely enjoyed working with you, helping
you and watching you learn.&amp;nbsp; Good luck and hopefully we&amp;#8217;ll continue to
see you around (and have contributions from you!) in the future.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;d
also like to thanks Mozilla for graciously allowing us to be part of
Google Summer of Code 2012 through&amp;nbsp;them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, feel free to stop by #instantbird on irc.mozilla.org (and,
yes, Instantbird supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;: you can&amp;#8217;t use the excuse that you don&amp;#8217;t
have an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; client!) to give us some feedback or ask&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;

improvements!&amp;nbsp; If you love Instantbird 1.1, you&amp;#8217;ll definitely appreciate
the improvements made in this release; and if you don&amp;#8217;t use Instantbird
yet&amp;#8230;well I&amp;#8217;d suggest you &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-all.html"&gt;give it a
try&lt;/a&gt;! You can read the
full list of changes (403 to be precise) in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/release-notes.html"&gt;release
notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantbird 1.2 took way more time to finish (10 months!) than we
originally expected, and even though there&amp;#8217;s a very long list of
improved details, there&amp;#8217;s no major new features. So you may wonder&amp;#8230;
what&amp;nbsp;happened?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the reason why it took so long is&amp;#8230;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;! The major
change that came with Instantbird 1.2 is that the chat back-end code is
now shared with Thunderbird, that will feature instant messaging support
in its version 15, to be released in a few&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forced us to give priority to some long standing side projects that
were interesting for Instantbird, but not immediately required: as
Thunderbird can&amp;#8217;t use libpurple which has an incompatible license, we
had to finish sooner, rather than later, some major architectural
changes to ensure that our chat back-end doesn&amp;#8217;t depend on libpurple at
all. That&amp;#8217;s right, Instantbird 1.2 is no longer based on libpurple (but
still uses it to support many protocols of&amp;nbsp;course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our back-end working without libpurple wasn&amp;#8217;t enough for Thunderbird:
the only protocol plug-in shipped in Instantbird 1.0 and 1.1 that didn&amp;#8217;t
use libpurple was Twitter; more were obviously needed. Fortunately, we
were already cooking a JavaScript implementation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMPP&lt;/span&gt; (started during
Google Summer of Code 2011) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; (it&amp;#8217;s been Patrick&amp;#8217;s side project
for years!). Our initial goal when we started working on these 2
protocol reimplementations in JavaScript was to gain full control of the
way these important protocols are handled by Instantbird, and to improve
their extensibility. For Thunderbird, finishing them became a priority,
and it&amp;#8217;s where we spent most of our&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#8217;m talking a lot about Thunderbird, you may be wondering if this
involvement of the Instantbird team in the Thunderbird project could
mean we are discontinuing the development of Instantbird as a
stand-alone application. Not at all! We believe both applications
complement each other very well, and have different use cases. While
Thunderbird, with integrated email and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt;, may be better for users who
work all day long with their email client and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; the same contacts; we
believe lots of home users tend to use a webmail instead of a local
email client and would prefer to keep their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; application&amp;nbsp;separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re very excited that Instantbird is developing closer ties with
Mozilla, who we think shares a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.en.html"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; of allowing
users, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;, to control their own privacy on the Internet! A few of our
developers are now &amp;#8220;peers&amp;#8221; of Mozilla&amp;#8217;s new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Chat"&gt;chat
module&lt;/a&gt;, and we are pursuing
more opportunities to bring Instantbird closer to Mozilla in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you&amp;#8217;ll enjoy using Instantbird 1.2 as much as we are and we
greatly look forward to the next version of Instantbird! As always, if
you see any bugs please &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org"&gt;file a
bug&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#instantbird"&gt;catch us on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:contact&amp;#64;instantbird.org"&gt;email
us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; channels (and other chatrooms). The goal, as always, is to make it
&amp;#8220;just work&amp;#8221; (so you can think about more important&amp;nbsp;things!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply press &lt;span style="background: Gainsboro;border: 1px outset Ghostwhite;padding: 2px;font-size: smaller"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to complete the first couple of letters you have&amp;nbsp;typed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tabc4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="alignnone size-full" src="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tabc4.png" style="width: 406px; height: 95px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To undo the completion, just press &lt;span style="background: Gainsboro;border: 1px outset Ghostwhite;padding: 2px;font-size: smaller"&gt;Backspace&lt;/span&gt; as&amp;nbsp;usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no unique nick that fits the bill, Instantbird tries to
guess which nick you mean from the context. For example, if you have
recently been pinged by someone, that nick is preferred. Otherwise it
just completes as much as possible, and shows you a list of
alternative&amp;nbsp;completions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc4-2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-full" src="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc4-2.png" style="width: 597px; height: 150px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then always press &lt;span style="background: Gainsboro;border: 1px outset Ghostwhite;padding: 2px;font-size: smaller"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; again to cycle through these candidate
nicks until you get the right&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc6-6.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="alignnone size-full" src="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc6-6.png" style="width: 605px; height: 127px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span style="background: Gainsboro;border: 1px outset Ghostwhite;padding: 2px;font-size: smaller"&gt;Shift&lt;/span&gt;+&lt;span style="background: Gainsboro;border: 1px outset Ghostwhite;padding: 2px;font-size: smaller"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will cycle through the list in the opposite&amp;nbsp;direction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how Instantbird automatically added a colon after the nick, as
we were addressing someone at the start of a message. And if you add
another nick, you get a comma-separated&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc8-6.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-full" src="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc8-6.png" style="width: 211px; height: 101px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, sometimes that may not be what you intended. So if you
delete the trailing colon by pressing &lt;span style="background: Gainsboro;border: 1px outset Ghostwhite;padding: 2px;font-size: smaller"&gt;Backspace&lt;/span&gt;, the punctuation
adjusts&amp;nbsp;accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc9-4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter size-full" src="http://blog.instantbird.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tc9-4.png" style="width: 211px; height: 101px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t forget you can also reply to any message by double-clicking it!
This will add the sender&amp;#8217;s nick to the beginning of the&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/p&gt;
