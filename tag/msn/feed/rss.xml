people experienced when trying to connect their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSN&lt;/span&gt; account on Windows.
Unfortunately, this issue wasn&amp;#8217;t detected during our testing prior to
the release and we are really sorry about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have Instantbird 0.1.2 on Windows (and if it doesn&amp;#8217;t crash at
startup because of an automatic connection to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSN&lt;/span&gt; account), you
will receive an automated update notification within 24 to 48&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the full version of Instantbird 0.1.2.1 from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download.html"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank our users who sent crash reports and useful
feedback, and congrats to the people who worked on the crash reporting
and automated update tools. Being able to notice, locate and fix quickly
such bugs with a small (21kB) update is just&amp;nbsp;amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
