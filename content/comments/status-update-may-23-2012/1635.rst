| Jess,
| We'd certainly love to support voice and video in Instantbird! Unfortunately no one is currently working on this, but there's a couple of bugs you could CC yourself if you'd like to get emails of when work starts: https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=568 for Audio/Video support in general and https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769 for GTalk. There doesn't seem to be one for SIP.

We have a Google Summer of Code student working on Account Import this summer, hopefully next summer we'll participate again; but we haven't discussed projects (although students can propose their own as well!).

Thanks for your feedback. :)
