| So I've just stumbled here while looking for a pidgin alternative. Nice GUI and cross platform.
| To be honest the thing I love most is your usage of tags, and being able to hide tags. Great idea.
| I look forward to seeing where it ends up!

I'm also about to try linking in my preferences folder to dropbox and running it on both linux and windows as I've been doing with Pidgin, fingers crossed.
