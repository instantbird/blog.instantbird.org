**@(anonymous)**: there are some packaging differences so even if Instantbird uses the same themes as Adium, the file is a little different (it needs to be a valid .xpi file for Instantbird). You will be able to download message themes from `addons.instantbird.org <https://addons.instantbird.org/>`__ once this site is ready (very soon!).
