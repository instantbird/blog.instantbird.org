**@Mads**: I think you are likely to really like the 'Paper Sheets' theme (also installed by default): it shows the time stamp right-aligned, in gray for the first message of a group and light gray for the next messages (which turns to normal gray when hovering for better readability).

For your suggestion of showing the time on the same line as the username in the 'Bubbles' theme, I think you missed the fact that we display the username only for the first message of a group.

I certainly disagree with your feeling that "users have to work harder" when provided with the direct answer to their question, rather than having to read and compute the answer using a numeric representation of the time. I think I explained this in the post already :).

In any case, thanks for your feedback!
