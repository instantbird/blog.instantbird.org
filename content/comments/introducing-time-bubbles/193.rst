This looks fantastic, excellent work Florian! It's great to see so much thought has been put into something that seems simple at first glance.

"I don't think that making the user responsible for choosing between two not-so-good options which one is best is a good way to address this issue."

Couldn't agree more, I'm so glad Instantbird is being developed with this sort of philosophy; when you look at clients like Miranda and they just cram in a million different options for a million different tastes and preferences, it's just embarrassing :-)
