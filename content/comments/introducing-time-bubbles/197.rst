I've no stats on this but the number & size of support groups such as National Self Harm Network imply that some significant proportion of I.M users will be having intense chats. In these sorts of chats your eye is literally on the clock & the time stamps to keep the responses close enough that the person on the other end hasn't time to do anything drastic or else to know that the silence has passed a critical benchmark (say how long a tourniquet has been on or an O/D taken. Admittedly these aren't your typical chats but I suspect there are enough such out there to make a category that genuinely needs second by second time in the chats.
