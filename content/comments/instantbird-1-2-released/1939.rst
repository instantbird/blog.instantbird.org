Hello guys,

I'm a little confused about hovering over a few of my friends on MSN.

| Sometimes I see :
| "has you No"
| "Blocked No"

| And sometimes :
| "Has you Yes"
| "Blocked No"

| What does the "Has you" mean?
| Is it part of "Has you blocked" as one who line?
| Or has you added as a friend?

Thanks!
