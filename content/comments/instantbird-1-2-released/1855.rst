Currently, the only way to do this is with an add-on. Such a 'sound theme' is basically a wrapper for the desired sound files. It's not difficult to do - look at https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/323 for an example. Feel free to ask for help on #instantbird if you have questions!
