| Some suggestions:
| - needs a taskbar icon
| - only \*one\* click on taskbar icon should open & close the app.
| - New account: XMPP should mention some prominent providers (e.g. Google Talk)
| - Common providers should be pre-configured (only need to enter UN&PW)
| - conference calls?
| - video calls?
| - conference + video calls?
