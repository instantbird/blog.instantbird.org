I hope you're enjoying Instantbird so far! Please let us know if you have any problems (on our bugtracker most likely: https://bugzilla.instantbird.org).

1. Sounds like you want the Smile! addon. :) (https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/318).

2. You want to disable incoming fonts, (Tools > Options > Formatting > "Display formatting of incoming messages" > Choose any option except "all").

3. Your buddies' avatars should show up fine, although there's been reports of issues on MSN.

4. :)

5. Conversation logging is either disabled or enabled. If it's enabled, logs are kept forever. This could be tweaked with an add-on, but I don't think anyone has created one to mess with this.
