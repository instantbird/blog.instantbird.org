I'm trying out IBird because Pidgin has started crashing for me for the last two versions during MSN convos.

1) What I miss most is an emoticon selection window that shows all emoticons from the currently active emoticon addon.

2) I'm using the excellent DarkChat 1.2 addon but the incoming messages show up as black (unless the other user has changed his color). I would like the option to override his text color.

3) Profile pics of my buddies ...

4) The icon/logo needs to be a bird, seriously.

5) How long are the convo logs kept ? Forever ? No option about it under Privacy.
