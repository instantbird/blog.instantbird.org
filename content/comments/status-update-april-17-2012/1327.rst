Happy to see the project is not dead. Seems like nothing has really been coming forth development-wise after such a major push out of the gate last year with version 1.

The do not disturb addon does not address what was asked for. One should not have to change one's status to have new conversations go on hold and actually, this is not about conversations going on hold. This is about new conversation windows simple being minimized.
