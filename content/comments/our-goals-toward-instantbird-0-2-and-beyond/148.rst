@Cane: Buddy icons are displayed in the conversation, but only if you use one of the converted Adium message themes. They are not available in any of the default message themes at this point. I know for sure they appear in Bishop. I personally like the current system and find that seeing the icon for the chat protocol gives me more information than a tiny version of an avatar.
