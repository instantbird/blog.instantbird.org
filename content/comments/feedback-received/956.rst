Well Instant Bird is my preferred im-client at the moment.

It is light non intrusive and works well.

I would recommend you to add some social networking option in it that I can use to share when I like.

| Problem I am facing with it are:
| 1. I got a huge friend list and when I enable buddy notification add on, the notifications just hang.

2. Instantbird hangs often handling my huge list and I have to restart it again.

3. To use additional feature like video or voice chat I still have to switch back to original client and I would love to see them here soon. I have seen many other other multi im messenger using them.

And at last just a suggestion. Though it is not-for-profit I would suggest you to add non intrusive ads like yahoo messenger and I hope your user will understand that. While it will be a revenue source for you.
