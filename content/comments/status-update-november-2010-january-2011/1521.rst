We'd actually really like to get rid of the status bar in general, we think there are better ways to show the information (i.e. typing notifications, number of characters left) then we're currently using it.

The tab color should also change (to green I believe) when your buddy is typing a message to you. :)

I don't know a way to always enable it off hand, but it should be possible with a userChrome.css hack.
