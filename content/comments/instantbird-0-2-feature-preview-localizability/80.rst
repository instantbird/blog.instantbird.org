**@Axel**: Libpurple doesn't use gettext context strings. Technically, we can change the libpurple code as much as we want because we have a fork in our repository, but I prefer to change it as little as possible, to reduce the pain when upgrading it and merging our modifications.

**@(anonymous)**: No. As far as I know, currently Telepathy uses libpurple (through telepathy-haze) for most of the protocols, so it would just be adding an additional layer. In the future this can evolve of course, so we may change our mind.
