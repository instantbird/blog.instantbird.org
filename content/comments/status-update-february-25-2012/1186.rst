the last time I tried instantbird it had version 1.0 (I guess), but right now I can't compile it due to in archlinux repos xulrunner is at version 10.0.2 so I can't compile instantbird 1.1 on xulrunner 10, I was told it compiles on xulrunner 7 but since arch is a rolling distro I can't get any outdated packages... if I try to compile them myself I have to compile some other packages too =((
