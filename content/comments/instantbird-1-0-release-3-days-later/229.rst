"Some people very kindly offered help and proposed to host the website on their server, but it's difficult to trust someone we barely know to host a website that requires our SSL certificate."

Have you tried to get any support from the Mozilla Foundation on this? People are constantly making remarks about how Mozilla is bigger than Mozilla Corporation/Firefox and many people know that and will point on their own to the Mozilla community. But the Mozilla Foundation makes a point of itself being bigger than the Corporation, too.

Given the way things happen to be, it would be hard to believe that claim if the Foundation were not to say "yes" without good reason, if you were to ask for help on some infrastructure. I mean, really. Instantbird is hosting its own Bugzilla instance and developer wiki, too!

If you don't mind, if you decide to look into this, I'd like to hear about any progress or news.
