| Good to read that Instantbird got so much attention, causing the servers to overload, and especially that you have solved the performance issues (by throwinng hardware at it ;-) ).
| I have developed two themes for Instantbird: LittleChat (based on LittleFox) and Nautipolis for Instantbird. And two more will follow soon...
| However I am not able to create an account on AIO, at least there is an account but it fails to send the confirmation email.

Greetings, Alfred
