As discussed on IRC, support for the basic IRC commands is needed to do joins, etc. from the chat window rather than going back to the connections interface. I also have the Same Place Jabber extension installed into Firefox that handle Jabber Chat, but I need IRC for Mozilla and other single server IRC connections.

What I am highly impressed by is Your an XULRunner application. The Thunderbird team is working to migrate to XULRunner. It would be fantastic if Instantbird evolved to work easily with Tbird.
