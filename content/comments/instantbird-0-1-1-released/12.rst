As a recent "switcher" to the Mac, I was surprised and a little disappointed to find that the premier IM app for OS X (Adium) was a beautiful-looking app, and yet was missing one feature that I had assumed to be basically "standard" for all such programs, based on my experience with GAIM/Pidgin: "Buddy Pounce". Since Instabird is based on Pidgin, can we assume that feature is included? If not, where does such a feature lie on the development roadmap? Thanks, good luck..
