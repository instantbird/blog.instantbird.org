One missing feature that's a showstopper in pidgin for a friend of mine is Invisibility support for gmail. I did some research on that a while back and found that it's hard to support because Google decided to screw up the XMPP protocol in some way. But if Instantbird were to support that feature, I could immediately recommend it to my friend to try. Do you happen to know if Instantbird has that?
