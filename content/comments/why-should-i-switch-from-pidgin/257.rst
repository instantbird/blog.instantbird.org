"Hey come on, we are in 2011, new machines have been shipping with gigabytes of memory for years already..."

| I generally agree that memory usage of apps, especially in the <50MB region shouldn't be an issue.
| And it shouldn't be a point that is used to prioritize bug reports, feature requests, etc.

| But, and that's a big but, almost all of my use cases pertaining to open source software rely on the fact that most of the tools are running on older machines as well.
| Almost all of my friends and customers (= all of the people who are enjoying software I recommend to them) have machines that are older than a couple of years.
| They are sufficiently fast and lean to get the jobs they need to get done, erm, done.
| And the age of those machines come with several restrictions. One of them being that they are often notebooks which are not able to be upgrade beyond a certain amount of memory.
| So being conservative on memory usage is a criteria for me when it comes to choose a certain tool over another.

| As you've said well a couple of times it isn't a competition. And it shouldn't be.
| But it should be a mantra to constantly drive memory usage down or at least hold it at a certain level.
