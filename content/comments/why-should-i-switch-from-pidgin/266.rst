Hallo!

| I just downloaded your program and Im happy with it. The cheerful interface and the comic-book bubbles are cool! I just have one question: On the "real" Yahoo Messenger you can selectively be visible/invisible to individual contacts. By this I mean you can do this:
| Contact 1 = invisible
| Contact 2 = invisible
| Contact 3= VISIBLE
| Contact 4 = invisible
| Will you make this feature available in InstantBird? Right now it seems its a blanket "Available" or "Unavailable"
| Thanks and keep up the good work! :-)
