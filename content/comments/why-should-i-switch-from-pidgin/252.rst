| I simply love Instantbird for the good CJK support, since Pidgin didn't and hasn't fix the issue and probably never will. (I heard it's a GTK issue?)
| Miranda IM works fine but I'm too lazy to customize everything. XD||\|
| The most important thing makes me use Instantbird is simply because of all the great developers!
| Thank you all for creating this nice application~ <3
