| That's why I had been always keeping an eye on Instantbird. The extensibility with addons like Firefox is what I love most about this project, that's the real potential. I love Firefox and Thunderbird because I can customized and add to it whatever I want, and just make it "my browser". I admit that I am currently a Pidgin user, because Instanbird still lacks some of the features I want before making the jump. The problem I see currently with Pidgin at least for me, is that the addons are very limited (even though some are awesome. ), rarely you see a new one. That's where I have faith in Instantbird, it's untapped potential which will be achieve once it's add on community grows as big as the ones in Firefox and Thunderbird, and it will happen. The great thing about it, is that all the future features don't depend on the main developer, but in the add on community and its creativity. If it isn't there, there's no need for a new version to come out, but rather a new add on being made.
| Some of the features or add ons, I look forward: Pop up for new messages (like Pidgin's Guifications), even better that feature in Digsby to reply to a message in the pop up (Pidgin will never had that), make the buddy list dockable to a side of the screen, display your current song on your status, see buddy pic on the buddy list, change the font of your contacts, and many more I can't think of right now, but someone might and make an addon for it.
| Glad seeing this project going mainstream and very excited to see it growing in the upcoming months. All the best
