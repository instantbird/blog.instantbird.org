Thanks for posting your talk for us to read! The usage graph was really interesting. I'm betting Facebook support has really helped adoption... I've seen a dramatic shift away from people using traditional chat services and using Facebook and Twitter for that... as well as SMS/mobile messaging. Glad to see IB is making waves!
