No, development is still chugging along! We're hoping to release Instantbird 1.2 soon. Unfortunately we got a bit busy (especially around the holidays) and our blog posts seem to have gotten dropped on the floor. :( Sorry about that! I'll see if I (or someone else) can whip up something soon to keep everyone informed about what's gone on in the last couple of months!

Thanks for your concern!
