| Hi Caspy7,
| don't worry, libpurple was not removed. We'll keep using it and you'll have all the protocols available that you used to have.

The change was made so that some parts of the Instantbird code (we have Javascript-based protocol plugins that aren't part of libpurple) can be re-used in another application that can't ship libpurple because of incompatible licensing.

| Best regards,
| Benedikt P.
