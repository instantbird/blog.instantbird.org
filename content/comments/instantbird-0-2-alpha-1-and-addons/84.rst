Hello,

I don't want to creat un bug for the first day ;-)

| The "experimental French language pack" don't work...
| Install ok --> but at the restart, Instanbird is always in english ...
| (maybe it's me, but i don't find any option for changing language and it's not "automatic")

| Sorry my first message is not better...
| But thank you for all this great job :-)
