| I like the minimize to tray, but just like MinTrayR is has some issues that's be nice to fix.
| 1.) MinTrayR has the ability to single or double click to open from the system tray icon
| 2.) It'd be nice to let it 'Always' stay in the tray - especially when I have lots of desktop and I'm not sure where it is...
| Other then that, great work!
