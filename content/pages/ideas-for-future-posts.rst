from flo: another idea for blog content: sometimes posting an image of a
work-in-progress with a very short description (a teaser) can bring some
interest. When I'm working on something which will be visible in the UI,
I often show a screenshot on IRC. So sometimes if you feel something I
(or Mic, or someone else) showed deserves some more visibility, you can
take it. or just encourage the person who showed it to blog it (it's
easy to upload an image for the blog with wordpress, right?) :)

from flo: another idea we had at some point for the blog, but that never
started because nobody was motivated to write the posts was to showcase
a cool/useful/interesting Instantbird add-on each week
