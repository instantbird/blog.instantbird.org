.. note::

    Weekly meetings are held every Monday at 4pm UTC (that's 6pm for
    people in France, and 9am for people in San Francisco) in
    `#instantbird on

The second weekly meeting discussed some final details for the 1.1 release,
which happened on October 18, 2011! Read the `blog post`_ about the release. In
addition, some plans for Instantbird 1.2 were discussed.

Development Issues Discussed:
-----------------------------

* Instantbird 1.1:

  - SSL Issues with GTalk
  - Focus issues on the buddy list
  - Release candidates for all localization prepared

* Instantbird 1.2:

  - Check in the backlog patches that have been reviewed
  - Update to Mozilla 8 or Mozilla 9
  - Integrate JavaScript protocols: clokep's JS-IRC and XMPP from our GSoC student
  - Strive toward making libpurple optional

Non-Development Issues Discussed:
---------------------------------

- Florian Quèze will be attending the `Google Summer of Code Mentor
  Summit <http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/2011>`__ this coming
  weekend
- Publicity for 1.1 release

**Ways to Help Out:**
---------------------

-  A QA/testing team would help to find regressions and bugs quickly
-  Help is needed in organizing the localization effort and keeping them
   up to date with information

Stop by at our next meeting on October 24, 2011 at 6:00 PM France time. 
Oh, and try out Instantbird 1.1 if you haven't (and tell your friends)!
