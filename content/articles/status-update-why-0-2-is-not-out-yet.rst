The last status update here was more than a month ago, so it's probably
time for another update. We are still working toward releasing
Instantbird 0.2 in the near future.

At this point, the code of the application is ready. Two points are
still holding the release though:

-  we have to rework the server side part of our update system, because
   the scripts we used on the server up to version 0.2b2 of Instantbird
   were not able to handle updates in several languages. We want to be
   sure that users who downloaded Instantbird 0.2 beta 2 in a
   non-English language will receive an updated version in the same
   language.
-  we are redesigning the main website of Instantbird. The goal of this
   redesign is partly to provide a visual refresh, but also to clarify
   the message. We are de-emphasizing the "multi-platform" argument (it
   is probably irrelevant to most users and is probably quickly
   understood by those who care about using Instantbird on more than one
   operating system), and we try to emphasis the simplicity and ease of
   use of Instantbird.

We look forward to putting Instantbird 0.2 in the hands of users who
didn't dare to try the beta releases.
