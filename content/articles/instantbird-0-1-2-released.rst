After a few months without any release, we are glad to announce the
release of `Instantbird
0.1.2 <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.1.2.html>`__!

What's new?
-----------

This version is more a stability/bugfix release than a feature release.

-  **Updated**: Instantbird 0.1.2 is now based on libpurple 2.4.3 and
   Mozilla 1.9.0.1.
-  **Improved stability**: we fixed the outstanding bugs that resulted
   in crashes. We also turned on breakpad to get more data on crashes.
-  **Detailed tooltips**: the tooltips of the buddy list now contain
   detailed information.
-  **Under the hood**: On this release we spent a lot of time on the
   build system. Instantbird can now be built like any other Mozilla
   application. It doesn't require to build dependencies separately any
   more. This results in smaller downloads (we package only the files
   that are really needed) and for developers it will now be easy to
   play with our code.

You can download Instantbird 0.1.2 for Windows, Linux or Mac from `this
page <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.1.2.html>`__. Of course you
can also download the source code.

We look forward to get your feedback on this release. You can comment on
this post or join us on IRC in #instantbird.
