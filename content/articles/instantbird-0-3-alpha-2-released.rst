We are pleased to announce that `Instantbird 0.3 alpha
2 <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3a2.html>`__ has just been
released.

This release contains the first visible changes on the road to making
Instantbird 0.3 awesome:

-  Contacts: If you talk to the same person on multiple IM networks you
   can now combine the buddies from each network into a single contact.
   Just drag and drop one onto the other and they will be merged!
-  Tags: Tags have replaced groups in the buddy list. Even though our
   tag system isn't fully implemented yet, there are already some new
   features. For example, a tag can be hidden by clicking the "x" on the
   right side of the buddy list, all buddies from this tag will then
   show in an "Other Contacts" tag automatically, which is shown at the
   bottom of the buddy list.
-  Windows (and Linux) users will appreciate the minimize to system tray
   feature, for which we borrowed some code from the popular MinTrayR
   add-on. By default Instantbird will minimize to tray when the "x" is
   clicked, to quit the application choose "Quit" from the File menu or
   right click on the system tray icon and choose "Quit". This behavior
   can be changed from the preferences window.
-  On Mac it's now possible to close the Contacts window without
   quitting the application. A click on the dock will reopen it.

This release also contains very significant invisible changes, including
the ability to create JavaScript protocol plugins and the upgrade to the
Mozilla 2.0 platform (which Firefox 4.0 is based on). Add-on developers
will like this, especially because of the new ability to create
`restartless
add-ons <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions>`__.
