We used to handle most support requests received from the contact AT
instantbird DOT org email address on a mailing list which was private.
This was inefficient as we replied to the same questions over and over
and people couldn't benefit from old replies. New posts to the mailing
list will now be publicly readable so that anybody in the community can
help users with support requests (see our
`guidelines <https://wiki.instantbird.org/Mailing_lists#Reply_guidelines>`__
describing how we have answered emails up to now), answer questions, or
just read the feedback we receive.

Anybody can subscribe to the Google group used:
http://groups.google.com/group/instantbird-contact

We have also created another mailing list for all bug changes, so that
people interested in knowing what's changed in our bugzilla can get the
information without requesting us to add them as globalwatchers on
bugzilla. See http://groups.google.com/group/instantbird-bugs

Note: if you don't have or don't want to use a Google account, you can
subscribe by email using the ``[Groupname]+subscribe@googlegroups.com``
address.
