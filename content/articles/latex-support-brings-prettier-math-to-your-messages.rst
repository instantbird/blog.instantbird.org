With our `new add-on <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/340/>`__,
any mathematics contained in your conversations will be beautifully
rendered using `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org>`__.

It's rather nice to be able to discuss math using familiar
`LaTeX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX>`__ markup, but with the
equations displayed properly. And of course, as LaTeX is text-based,
this works for all protocols, and does not depend on your conversation
partners also using Instantbird!

No configuration is necessary -- to use this, you don't even need to
have TeX installed.

You can easily obtain the LaTeX source of any equation using the context
menu. AMSmath symbols and environments (such as
``\\begin{align}...\\end{align}``) are supported.

There are a few customization options -- for example, you can choose to
have displayed equations numbered automatically, to make them easier to
refer to.

The add-on works with all Instantbird message styles, so you don't have
to change your favourite theme.
