Another very visible change between Instantbird 0.2 and 0.3 is the
possibility to set a user icon and a display name.

You will see a place holder icon at the top of the buddy list, just
click it (this will open a file picker) to set an icon. The icon will be
automatically resized and converted to fit the various size and format
requirements of the IM networks you use.

Similarly, click the "Display name" place holder to edit it. This name
will be visible in your contacts' buddy lists (unfortunately this
currently works only for MSN).

Here you go, your friends will now easily recognize you:

Conversation windows have also been changed to display your contacts'
icons and some more information (display name, status message, ...):

I can already hear some comments about how much space this new
information bar takes (or wastes) in all conversation windows. Yes,
this takes a lot of space, we know. People tend to use big or very big
windows for chatting (sometimes even full screen!) but if you like the
ability to chat in small windows, don't worry, we love you too! Just
resize the window and this information bar will shrink to ensure you
still see the actual content of the conversation:

And for very small conversation windows, the bar will completely
disappear, leaving only the strictly necessary user interface:
