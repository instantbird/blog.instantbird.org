The Instantbird team is pleased to announce a polished **Instantbird
1.0**, released today in 11 locales.

|Instantbird logo|

Instantbird is an extremely easy to use and highly **extensible instant
messaging** client that aims to respect its users!

Building on the experience available via **open-source** software,
Instantbird is able to harness the power of Pidgin (via its libpurple
protocol library) and of Mozilla's Firefox technology, to provide access
to a wide variety of instant messaging networks, while providing an easy
(and well known) extension platform. Although Instantbird is **fully
cross-platform** (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), we strive to present a
**native look-and-feel** to the user interface.

Supported networks
------------------

First and foremost, Instantbird is an instant messaging client with a
wide variety of supported networks, including:

-  AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)
-  Facebook Chat
-  Google Talk
-  Twitter
-  Windows Live Messenger (MSN Messenger)
-  XMPP (Jabber)
-  Yahoo! Messenger

But also many others like: Gadu-Gadu, Novell Groupwise, ICQ, IRC,
MySpaceIM, Netsoul, QQ, SIMPLE, Yahoo! JAPAN, and even more optionally
available on the `Instantbird Add-Ons
website <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/>`__, such as
`Omegle <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/269>`__
and `LJ Talk
(LiveJournal) <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/255>`__.

Extensibility
-------------

We feel that a user should be able to make their instant messaging
client their own: we feel Instantbird can be customized best by giving
the user a **simple and efficient** user interface, and not attempting
to include hundreds of bundled options, but allowing the user to
**customize** via the powerful extensibility included in the Mozilla
platform. All elements of Instantbird are customizable, from the message
theme itself (we've built on the great message style format used in
Adium) to the Instantbird theme, user interface and protocols. There are
already over 250 add-ons available, here are some of our favorites:

-  `Colorize <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/248>`__
   -- change a buddy's color in a private conversation based on their
   name
-  `Highlight <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/250>`__
   -- be notified of certain words in a chat as if they were your
   nickname
-  `Tab
   Complete <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/276>`__
   -- tab completion of nicknames and commands
-  `Reply to
   Nick <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/249>`__
   -- allows easy replying: double clicking a message in the chat
   inserts the sender's name in the message input box
-  `Show
   Nick <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/251>`__
   -- colors the nicknames in messages in multi-user chats
-  `Vertical
   Tabs <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/244>`__
   -- too many conversations open? Move the tabs from horizontal to
   vertical!

Respecting users
----------------

As part of our belief in **respecting our users**, we give them an
**ad-free experience** and respect their privacy by not collecting any
information about them (Instantbird contacts our servers only when
checking for updates, or in the unfortunate and uncommon event of a
crash).

About us
--------

The Instantbird team is a group of volunteers who are passionate about
empowering instant messaging users by providing a stable, fun instant
messenger. Read more about `who we
are <http://instantbird.com/about.html>`__ and `our core beliefs and
values <http://instantbird.org/>`__.

While Instantbird has received invaluable support from the Mozilla
community at large, it hasn't been funded in any way by the Mozilla
Foundation. The company-quality infrastructure deployed to build and
support Instantbird has been funded by the initial creators who strongly
believe in the importance of this project. The increasingly fast growth
of Instantbird's user base leads us to believe the project could find
some user-respecting revenue streams from which the project could become
economically sustainable and empower the non-profit created for it to
start hiring key contributors, following a model similar to what Mozilla
has been doing with Firefox.

We'd like to thank all of our `contributors and
translators <http://www.instantbird.com/thanks.html>`__ who have helped
build Instantbird. In addition, we'd also like to thank our invaluable
beta and nightly testers who provide timely bug reports and help track
down regressions!
