Instantbird is participating in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) again this
year as part of Mozilla and we will be mentoring one student: Will
Nayes.  The abstract for his project is:

    .. rubric:: Instantbird Account Import Wizard
       :name: instantbird-account-import-wizard

    When evaluating a new messaging client, the common frustration of
    reconfiguring accounts and settings is difficult to avoid. To combat
    similar issues, the developers at Mozilla have implemented account
    import wizards in their Firefox and Thunderbird software packages. I
    propose creating an Account Import Wizard for the IM client
    Instantbird, which will provide users with a flexible way to import
    profile data from existing messaging client installations.

Will is in contact with us via our IRC channel #instantbird (on
irc.mozilla.org) during the community bonding period. We'd love for you
to stop by and help welcome wnayes to our community. We're extremely
excited to have Will working with us this summer!

We'd like to thank Mozilla for letting us apply to Google Summer of Code
with them!  You can see all of Mozilla's accepted applications on the
`GSoC 2012
