`Instantbird 0.3 alpha
1 <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3a1.html>`__ has just been
released.

This release contains very significant changes, including the ability to
create JavaScript protocol plugins and the upgrade to the Mozilla 2.0
platform. Most of the changes are not yet visible in the user interface,
so we would not advise current users of the 0.2 version to update.

However, it includes basic support for Twitter and is already quite
stable; so it will please early adopters and testers who don't go as far
as to use `nightly builds <http://nightly.instantbird.im/>`__ (which
update themselves everyday with the newest code). Add-on developers will
also be interested, especially because of the new ability to create
restartless add-ons.
