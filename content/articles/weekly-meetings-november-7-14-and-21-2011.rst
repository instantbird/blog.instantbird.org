We've been a bit bad about posting summaries of our weekly meetings the
past few weeks, but that doesn't mean nothings been going on! In fact,
we've had a lot of major changes coming down the pipeline: here's a
summary of what's new with Instantbird.

    .. compound::

        Weekly meetings are held every Monday at 4pm UTC (that’s 6pm for
        people in France, and 9am for people in San Francisco) in
        `#instantbird on
        irc.mozilla.org <irc://irc.mozilla.org/instantbird>`__.

What's Been Done?
-----------------

-  Dependency on libpurple has been eliminate: this included a big
   rewrite of the core service and how accounts and statuses were
   handled.
-  Florian attended MozCamp and gave `a talk on
   Instantbird <https://wiki.mozilla.org/EU_MozCamp_2011/Schedule/Product_and_Technology_Track/Instantbird>`__.
-  Participants in chat rooms are now only colored once they've
   participated.
-  Mozilla has been updated from 7.0.1 to 9.0 beta 2.
-  Many small back logged patches have been checked-in.

What's Been Happening?
----------------------

-  Fixing fallout from the upgrade to Mozilla 9.0 beta 2.
-  Work on `integrating
   JS-XMPP <https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1171>`__.
-  Work on `integrating
   JS-IRC <https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507>`__.
-  Work on integrating SIPE (Microsoft Office Communicator protocol).

There's been lots of big changes landing, and more to come! Although
many of them are back end changes, they'll pave the way for more visible
features in the future.  We'll try to do a better job of keeping our
blog up to date with what's going on.

As always, full chat logs and the EtherPad is available for each
meeting; November 7 (`chat
logs <http://log.bezut.info/instantbird/111107/#m370>`__,
`etherpad <https://etherpad.mozilla.org/instantbird-weekly-meeting-20111107>`__),
November 14

and November 21 (`chat
logs <http://log.bezut.info/instantbird/111121/#m252>`__,
`etherpad <https://etherpad.mozilla.org/instantbird-weekly-meeting-20111121>`__). 
Note that no real discussion occurred on November 14th, just a summary
of the week's progress.
