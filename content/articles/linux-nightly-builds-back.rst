Back in March, we posted that we had started
`building nightly builds from mozilla-central/comm-central`_, but because the
version of CentOS we had been using was too old, we were unable to continue
providing Linux nightly builds. That has now changed and (as of today) we have
**both 32-bit and 64-bit** Linux nightlies! Since this involved us installing a
new operating system (CentOS 6.2) and tweaking some of the build configuration
for Linux, please `let us know`_ if you see any issues! Additionally, some more
up-to-date features that have been available in Mozilla Firefox for a while
should now be available in Instantbird (e.g. dbus and pulse audio support) and
`even some minor bugs were fixed`_!

Sorry that this took so long, but `go grab your updated copy now`_!
