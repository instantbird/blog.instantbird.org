Instantbird again has the pleasure of participating in `Google Summer of Code`_
under the Mozilla umbrella. In `the`_ `past`_ we've had a variety of exciting
projects and this year is no different. Three students will be working with us
this summer:

`Saurabh Anand`_ (sawrubh), mentored by `Patrick Cloke`_ (clokep), will aim to
add support for reliable file transfer to Instantbird using `FileLink`_ as a
fallback to standard file transfer.

`Mayank Kumar`_ (mayanktg), mentored by Benedikt P. (Mic), will be adding voice
and video support to Instantbird by integrating `WebRTC`_ for XMPP. WebRTC makes
it easy for us to have real-time communication without the use of additional
plugins.

`Nihanth Subramanya`_ (nhnt11), who last year added the "`awesometab`_", will be
looking to improve loading of conversations and history under the guidance of
aleth. He will work on adding the ability to search across all logs of a contact
and loading the previous context of a conversation when scrolling ("infinite
scroll").

Please feel free to stop by `#instantbird on irc.mozilla.org`_ to say hello and
congratulate our students! Thanks again to Mozilla for allowing us to
participate in Google Summer of Code with them!
