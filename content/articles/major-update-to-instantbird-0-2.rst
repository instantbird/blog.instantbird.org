As no critical issues have been reported in the `recently released
Instantbird 0.2`_,
we have turned on major updates for users of Instantbird 0.1.2 and
0.1.3. If you are still using one of these old versions, you will
receive a major update offer to get the newer Instantbird 0.2. It will
look like this:

Unfortunately, due to a bug of the updater that shipped in the Windows
version of Instantbird 0.1.3.1, the update won't be automatic for these
users, who should `download the full
installer <http://www.instantbird.com/>`__ themselves. We are sorry for
the inconvenience.
