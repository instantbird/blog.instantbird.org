I'm excited to announce the release of `Instantbird 0.3
beta <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html>`__, the first
localized preview of what we have been working on for months, available
in 10 locales (Czech, German, English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Polish,
Russian, Slovak and Ukrainian)!

In addition to the cool features already introduced in the previous two
alpha releases (among which the Twitter support, tags, contacts merging,
...), this beta brings significant appearance changes with user icons,
an updated tab style, the `improved default message theme`_,
Aero glass effects on Windows and
`more <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html>`__ awesome new
features!

As `Instantbird 0.3 <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html>`__
is almost finished and already localized, thanks to the great work of
our localizers who were eager to share Instantbird with people speaking
their language, this beta release is a great opportunity to `give
Instantbird a try <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html>`__,
play with it, and `report bugs <https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/>`__!

`Download Instantbird 0.3 beta
now <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html>`__!

We look forward to receiving your feedback to help us make the final
Instantbird 0.3 release (planned for this month!) a piece of software
you will want to share with all your friends!
