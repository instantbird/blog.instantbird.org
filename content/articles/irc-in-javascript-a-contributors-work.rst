A short time after Instantbird 0.2 was released the `js-proto branch`_ was
merged into the main development tree. This was the branch where the
backend of Instantbird was prepared to support protocol plugins written
entirely in Javascript. Not long after that, Patrick Cloke, an active
contributor of the project, started working on an implementation of the
IRC protocol plugin in Javascript.

Now he has written a long and detailed posting on his blog about the
hows and whys, as well as the current status of his work. It's spiced
with lots of references to both Instantbird and specifications of the
protocol. So if you're interested in the technical aspects of
Instantbird and how to extend Instantbird with a protocol plugin written
in JS then you definitely should go and read it at `his
blog <http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2010/12/08/why-rewrite-irc-into-javascript/>`__.
