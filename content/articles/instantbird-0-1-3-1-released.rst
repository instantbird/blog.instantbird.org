We have just released a small update to Instantbird 0.1.3. This will fix
the connection issue with ICQ that appeared a little more than two weeks
ago (sorry it took so long!) and improve the stability. You can download
this new 0.1.3.1 release from `this
page <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.1.3.1.html>`__ or just click
on the 'Check for updates' menu to download only a small update file.

We are going to post a status update about the progress of the
development of the 0.2 version soon.
