.. note::

    Weekly meetings are held every Monday at 4pm UTC (that's 6pm for
    people in France, and 9am for people in San Francisco.)

The first weekly status meeting, which everyone is encouraged to attend,
was held on #instantbird (irc.mozilla.org) and flo, clokep and aleth
lead the discussions. (`Full chat
logs <http://log.bezut.info/instantbird/111010/>`__ are available, as
well as the `Etherpad
timelime <https://etherpad.mozilla.org/ep/pad/view/instantbird-weekly-meeting-20111010/latest>`__.)

The meeting's primary focus was about the pending 1.1 release (if you're
reading this before 1.1 goes gold, nightlies are available at
http://ftp.instantbird.com/instantbird/nightly/latest-trunk/ and testing
is always appreciated!)

Development Issues Discussed:
-----------------------------

-  [STRIKEOUT:SSL issue.] Fixed
-  [STRIKEOUT:Translations not yet 1.1 compliant.] Fixed

Non-Development Issues Discussed:
---------------------------------

* Establishment of the non-profit foundation to support Instantbird

  - Specifically the creation of a bank account for funds and starting
    ideas to generate capital
  - We are still seeking suggestions for good web-based systems to let
    the non-profit receive donations (ideally with minimal transaction
    charges and must be accepting of most international currencies)
  - Thinking about ways to get more people to use Instantbird's
    Amazon-affiliate code when making purchases

* New WordPress-powered blog is launched, letting more Instantbird
  developers share in the blog's upkeep and helping to expand its audience
* Florian Quèze will be attending the `Google Summer of Code Mentor
  Summit <http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/2011>`__, so say hi if you
  are attending

*If you read this full post, here is an extra sneak peak for you: Check
out the `full list of new features in 1.1`_! More details on them
are on the way, that's why this is just a sneak peek.*
