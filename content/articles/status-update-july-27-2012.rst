Sorry that we have been so awful at updating our blog again, but we have
been busy working on getting Instantbird 1.2 ready for release!  We're
hoping to get this release out the door in the next few weeks (there's a
few final blockers we're attempting to fix)!

A few weeks ago (in the beginning of July), Instantbird was string
frozen for 1.2.  This means that no new patches will be accepted (for
1.2) which change any strings, this gives our localization (l10n) teams
time to translate Instantbird 1.2 into different languages. 
`Instantbird 1.1 was
released <http://www.instantbird.com/download-all.html>`__ in 13
languages: Czech, German, English, Spanish, Estonian, French, Italian,
Dutch, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Swedish and Ukrainian!  Hopefully we can
release Instantbird 1.2 in even more languages!  Unfortunately not all
of these languages have been updated yet, so if you're interested in
translating Instantbird to your language, check out the `translation
information <https://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Translation>`__
and `get in contact with
us <http://instantbird.com/about.html#get_in_touch>`__!

Additionally, our Google Summer of Code student, `Will
Nayes <http://www.tc.umn.edu/~nayes006/gsoc2012/index.php>`__, has been
doing excellent work and already has importers working for Colloquy,
Google Talk, mIRC, Pidgin, Windows Live Messenger and XChat!  He's
currently working on importing logs from each of these clients so you
can smoothly transition from other clients to Instantbird without any
data loss.  We hope Will is enjoying working on Instantbird as he's
doing a great job!
