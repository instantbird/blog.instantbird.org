We are glad to announce the release of `Instantbird
0.1.1 <http://www.instantbird.com/download.html>`__.

This release is mostly a bug fix release. We've been impressed by the
success of the 0.1 release and thought it would be nice to deliver a
more stable version for the users we already have before making big
changes for version 0.2.

The things we focused on for this release are:

-  **Improved stability**: we fixed the outstanding bugs that resulted
   in crashes.
-  Proper handling of non-ASCII characters. Instantbird now uses UTF-8
   for all strings.
-  **Usability improvements**. We fixed bugs that didn't require much of
   our time and will significantly improve the user experience. For
   examples: aliases in the buddy list, linkification in the chat
   window, ... We also **removed some common annoyances** in the UI.
-  **IRC Chats**. In order to build a community, we thought it was
   critical to provide some way for users and testers to talk in a
   public place and not only send us private messages. There is now in
   the "File" menu a "Join Chat" item which will allow users and future
   contributors to join us in irc.mozilla.org#instantbird

We look forward to get your feedback on this release. You can comment in
this blog or join us on IRC.

We would like to thank the early testers and users of the 0.1 release
who provided some great feedback and helped us make Instantbird better!
