For the third year in a row, Instantbird will be participating in Google Summer
of Code. Last year, Will Nayes worked on an `Account Import Wizard`_ and in 2011,
Varuna Jayasiri worked on our `JavaScript XMPP implementation`_ (currently used by
Google Talk and Facebook accounts in Instantbird, as well as Google Talk,
Facebook and XMPP in Thunderbird).

Instantbird will be mentoring three student projects this year:

    **Additional JavaScript Protocol Plug-ins (Yahoo!)**

    The goal of this project is to reimplement Yahoo! Messenger support in
    Instantbird using JavaScript and XPCOM interfaces. — `Quentin Headen`_
    (qheaden)


    **FileLinks in Instant Messages**

    The Thunderbird Filelink feature allows users to upload attachments to an
    online storage service, replacing the email attachment with a link. This
    existing code could be used to implement file transfer. While some protocols
    support file transfer directly, this approach would provide a fallback that
    should always work. Designing and implementing a good UI frontend would also
    be required. — `Atul Jangra`_ (atuljangra)


    **Instantbird Awesometab**

    I propose to develop a “smart” user interface, in the form of a
    user-openable tab, that allows the user to quickly and efficiently open new
    chats – based on who they chat with most often, and on what accounts they do
    so. The user should be able to go from actively chatting in one conversation
    to doing so in a new one, losing no time in finding the contact to start the
    conversation with, refocusing to the correct UI element, or opening extra
    windows. — `Nihanth Subramanya`_ (nhnt11)

For the next few weeks the students are encouraged to bond with their community.
All three have been active in recent weeks on our IRC channel (#instantbird on
irc.mozilla.org), feel free to stop by and say hello! The Instantbird team looks
forward to working with all of them during the summer. You can check out their
blogs (linked to above) and back here for progress throughout the summer.

We’d like to thank Mozilla for letting us apply to Google Summer of Code as part
of them! You can see the other student projects Mozilla is mentoring on the
`Google Summer of Code site`_.
