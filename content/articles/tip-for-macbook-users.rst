Instantbird 0.2 uses the multitouch feature of Macbook touchpads in
conversation windows:

-  Pinch in or out 2 fingers to change the zoom level.
-  Swipe up (3 fingers) to scroll to the top of the conversation, down
   to scroll to the last message. This saves time when looking for an
   old messages in the conversation (for example, using the Find
   feature) and then going back to the display of the most recent
   messages.
-  Twist left or right to select the tab at the left or right of the
   currently selected tab.
-  Swipe left or right (3 fingers) to change the selected tab to the
   previously selected tab. This gesture is probably the most useful
   one: it's very convenient when reading quickly a message in a newly
   opened tab and then going back to the conversation tab where an
   active conversation is occurring, or when actively participating in 2
   discussions and repeatedly switching between 2 tabs.
