We released Instantbird 0.1 about a month ago. It has been downloaded
more than 1600 times the first day, about 80000 downloads from our
servers (the exact number right now is 79497), and we know some
unofficial mirrors have been put online.

Of course, we know that 80000 downloads doesn't mean 80000 users, but we
are really happy to see that so many people were interested by the
project enough to go ahead and download it. Thank you!
