`Mozilla`_ is doing `Google Summer of Code 2013`_ and
Instantbird is interested in participating again. Instantbird
participated (through Mozilla) the last two years with
`JS-XMPP`_ (by varuna in 2011) and the `Import Wizard`_
(by wnayes in 2012).  Both projects were successful: Instantbird and
Thunderbird use our JavaScript XMPP code and we're hoping to integrate
the Import Wizard into Instantbird soon, after which the UI could then
be uplifted into Thunderbird.

It is time to start thinking about (and brainstorming) ideas for the
chat in this year's GSoC! We've already started
`brainstorming <https://etherpad.mozilla.org/ib-gsoc-2013>`__ and came
up with some ideas, but would love to get more ideas from people.
Remember that a good GSoC project needs to be something that can be
completed by a student in ~8 weeks (but also has to keep a student busy
the whole time!).  It should also be something that we would want to
integrate into Instantbird by default and have expected behavior already
defined.

Feel free to come chat with us on IRC (#instantbird on
`irc.mozilla.org <http://irc.mozilla.org>`__) about this or any other
topic!
