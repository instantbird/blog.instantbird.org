We plan to use the Mozilla password manager for them someday.

&lt;p&gt;Most protocols use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; by default if it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Can you please tell us more about the default security? How are passwords stored internally, and do the chat protocols default to using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt;?&amp;nbsp;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

In the past our various requests have been denied, except the latest one: they agreed that we participate in Google Summer of Code with the Mozilla organization, and we are benefiting this year from a Google Summer of Code student :). Now that the project has gained some maturity (we have been around for almost 4 years!) and visibility, I think we would be more likely to get help. However I don&amp;#8217;t expect decisions (either way) to be taken immediately, and for this server issue we needed a solution &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#64;Alfred&lt;/strong&gt;I&amp;#8217;m glad you are developing themes for Instantbird. We have just reconfigured the email server and the problem should be fixed: you should be able to create an account on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIO&lt;/span&gt;. If the problem persists, please contact us&amp;nbsp;:).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Good to read that Instantbird got so much attention, causing the servers to overload, and especially that you have solved the performance issues (by throwinng hardware at it ;-) ).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I have developed two themes for Instantbird: LittleChat (based on LittleFox) and Nautipolis for Instantbird. And two more will follow soon&amp;#8230;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;However I am not able to create an account on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIO&lt;/span&gt;, at least there is an account but it fails to send the confirmation email.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you tried to get any support from the Mozilla Foundation on this? People are constantly making remarks about how Mozilla is bigger than Mozilla Corporation/Firefox and many people know that and will point on their own to the Mozilla community. But the Mozilla Foundation makes a point of itself being bigger than the Corporation,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the way things happen to be, it would be hard to believe that claim if the Foundation were not to say &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221; without good reason, if you were to ask for help on some infrastructure. I mean, really. Instantbird is hosting its own Bugzilla instance and developer wiki,&amp;nbsp;too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#8217;t mind, if you decide to look into this, I&amp;#8217;d like to hear about any progress or&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/p&gt;
