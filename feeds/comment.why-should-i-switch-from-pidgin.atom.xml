&lt;p&gt;Also, I bet you would get a much faster adoption rate by simply getting a fancier/nicer looking logo that better matched the Firefox/Thunderbird animal hugging the task theme. People are weird like&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;I just downloaded your program and Im happy with it. The cheerful interface and the comic-book bubbles are cool! I just have one question: On the &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; Yahoo Messenger you can selectively be visible/invisible to individual contacts. By this I mean you can do this:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Contact 1 = invisible …&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hallo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Contact 4 = invisible&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Will you make this feature available in InstantBird? Right now it seems its a blanket &amp;#8220;Available&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Unavailable&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Thanks and keep up the good work! :-)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I generally agree that memory usage of apps, especially in the &amp;lt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;50MB&lt;/span&gt; region shouldn&amp;#8217;t be an issue.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;I generally agree that memory usage of apps, especially in the &amp;lt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;50MB&lt;/span&gt; region shouldn&amp;#8217;t be an issue.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a point that is used to prioritize bug reports, feature requests, etc.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But, and that&amp;#8217;s a big but, almost all of my use cases pertaining to open source software rely on the fact that most of the tools are running on older machines as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Almost all of my friends and customers (= all of the people who are enjoying software I recommend to them) have machines that are older than a couple of years.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They are sufficiently fast and lean to get the jobs they need to get done, erm, done.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And the age of those machines come with several restrictions. One of them being that they are often notebooks which are not able to be upgrade beyond a certain amount of memory.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So being conservative on memory usage is a criteria for me when it comes to choose a certain tool over another.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;As you&amp;#8217;ve said well a couple of times it isn&amp;#8217;t a competition. And it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But it should be a mantra to constantly drive memory usage down or at least hold it at a certain level.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;I really do like instantbird and I&amp;#8217;m willing switch to it but there are a few things preventing me from doing so. One is the inability to block a contact or just appear offline to it. I&amp;#8217;ve got some colleagues and professors that I have on my list and I just can&amp;#8217;t delete them but I also don&amp;#8217;t want to talk to them, so in my case, a block feature is a dire need. Secondly I can&amp;#8217;t see the display picture of any of my contact. While that isn&amp;#8217;t a major problem, it&amp;#8217;s still something that can be missed. A third item I would like to see in instantbird is a mail checker. Perhaps something similar to the &amp;#8220;watcher&amp;#8221; addon series that are present in firefox&amp;#8217;s database could suffice (Hotmail Watcher, Gmail Watcher, Yahoo! Mail Watcher). Another feature I&amp;#8217;d like to see in instantbird is the ability to enlarge and reposition icons in the main window. It&amp;#8217;s easier to identify a contact by their dp instead of their nickname, so in my opinion we could make use of the option of enlarging and shrinking display pictures that are found in the contact list. I&amp;#8217;ve got one last suggestion and that is giving the users the ability to utilize custom sounds. One thing I love about instantbird is the ability to customize it, and that feature should be extended to the sounds as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;If any of these features are found but I have failed to discover them then please point me to where they are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;On another note, Instantbird starts up real quickly, and rarely ever gives start up errors which is an indispensable feature. Keep up the good work :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
