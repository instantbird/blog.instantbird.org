    <div class="section" id="servers-load">
<h2>Servers&nbsp;load</h2>
<p>Instantbird 1.0 has been very quickly downloaded over ten thousand of
times. In fact, it happened so fast (especially immediately after we
have been <a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/5816618/instantbird-is-a-lightweight-cross+platform-instant-messaging-app-with-sharp-looks">featured on
lifehacker</a>)
that our server couldn&#8217;t handle the&nbsp;load.</p>
<p>We have very quickly been able to mirror our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/">main
website</a> on another server, which
allowed people to keep discovering and downloading Instantbird 1.0, but
we had to close the add-ons website for a while as the load it couldn&#8217;t
handle was also putting down other services that we really needed to
keep online, especially our <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/">bug
database</a>.</p>
<p>We have tried to re-open the add-ons website at a quieter time, but the
server was unresponsive again within half an hour. This morning we tried
to improve the website&#8217;s performance by adding some caching mechanism
and reopened again (at a time when most Americans are asleep) for a try.
Again it fall&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Some people very kindly offered help and proposed to host the website on
their server, but it&#8217;s difficult to trust someone we barely know to host
a website that requires our <span class="caps">SSL</span>&nbsp;certificate.</p>
<p>As the add-ons website had been closed for almost 2 days already (sorry
for the inconvenience!) and extensibility is a key differentiator of
Instantbird compared to other similar <span class="caps">IM</span> clients, we decided that this
situation couldn&#8217;t last any longer and we solved the problem by throwing
money at it: we ordered a beefier server (Quad Core <span class="caps">CPU</span>, <span class="caps">16GB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span>)
and migrated the add-ons website to it as quickly as we could. The
website reopened this afternoon, and our testing confirmed that the new
server can easily handle the load, even with more visitors than we had
when the previous server stopped responding. It&#8217;s ready for a lot more
people coming! Don&#8217;t hesitate to tell your friends to try Instantbird
<img alt=":)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/sourire.png" />.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="feedback">
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>We have received a massive amount of feedback since the release. Most
was positive or extremely positive. We received lots of encouragements.
We even received some love&nbsp;letters!</p>
<p>Some of the feedback showed there was some confusion, for example about
how we are different from Pidgin (which we will be the subject of
another post to clarify things). We also received constructive
criticism, good bug reports. The most common request is an easy way to
retweet or to reply to a tweet. We will work on that soon <img alt=":)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/sourire.png" />. Tab
completion of nick names is also commonly requested, but even though
it&#8217;s clear we need to have this by default in the future, we can usually
satisfy the reporter by pointing to the great (restartless!) <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/276">Tab
Complete</a>&nbsp;add-on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updates">
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>As no alarming issue has been reported in Instantbird 1.0 which is
already widely used, we have decided to turn on major updates from
Instantbird 0.2 to Instantbird&nbsp;1.0.</p>
<p>Users of Instantbird 0.2 will be offered an update shortly with an
update prompt looking like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="Dialog offering a major update to Instantbird 1.0" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/major-update-1.0.png" /></p>
<p>Users of our 0.3pre nightly builds will be offered an update to a
nightly build numbered 1.1a1pre in the next few&nbsp;days.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, it&#8217;s been a great release and the last few days have been
exciting (even though they were also exhausting). We look forward to
continue hearing your feedback (and to actually act upon it!). Don&#8217;t
hesitate to share Instantbird with your friends. Our servers are&nbsp;ready!</p>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2011/06/instantbird-1-0-released-in-11-locales/" rel="bookmark">Instantbird 1.0 released in 11&nbsp;locales!</a></h1>
  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Instantbird team is pleased to announce a polished <strong>Instantbird
1.0</strong>, released today in 11&nbsp;locales.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/"><img alt="Instantbird logo" src="http://www.instantbird.com/press/logos/instantbird-text-512x128.png" /></a></p>
<p>Instantbird is an extremely easy to use and highly <strong>extensible instant
messaging</strong> client that aims to respect its&nbsp;users!</p>
<p>Building on the experience available via <strong>open-source</strong> software,
Instantbird is able to harness the power of Pidgin (via its libpurple
protocol library) and of Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox technology, to provide access
to a wide variety of instant messaging networks, while providing an easy
(and well known) extension platform. Although Instantbird is <strong>fully
cross-platform</strong> (Windows, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, Linux), we strive to present a
<strong>native look-and-feel</strong> to the user&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/">Get Instantbird 1.0&nbsp;now!</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/"><img alt="Instantbird 1.0 screenshot on Windows 7" src="http://www.instantbird.com/press/screenshots/1.0-winaero-screenshot-homepage-big.png" /></a></p>
<div class="section" id="supported-networks">
<h2>Supported&nbsp;networks</h2>
<p>First and foremost, Instantbird is an instant messaging client with a
wide variety of supported networks,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="caps">AOL</span> Instant Messenger (<span class="caps">AIM</span>)</li>
<li>Facebook&nbsp;Chat</li>
<li>Google&nbsp;Talk</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Windows Live Messenger (<span class="caps">MSN</span>&nbsp;Messenger)</li>
<li><span class="caps">XMPP</span>&nbsp;(Jabber)</li>
<li>Yahoo!&nbsp;Messenger</li>
</ul>
<p>But also many others like: Gadu-Gadu, Novell Groupwise, <span class="caps">ICQ</span>, <span class="caps">IRC</span>,
MySpaceIM, Netsoul, <span class="caps">QQ</span>, <span class="caps">SIMPLE</span>, Yahoo! <span class="caps">JAPAN</span>, and even more optionally
available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/">Instantbird Add-Ons
website</a>, such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/269">Omegle</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/255"><span class="caps">LJ</span> Talk
(LiveJournal)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extensibility">
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>We feel that a user should be able to make their instant messaging
client their own: we feel Instantbird can be customized best by giving
the user a <strong>simple and efficient</strong> user interface, and not attempting
to include hundreds of bundled options, but allowing the user to
<strong>customize</strong> via the powerful extensibility included in the Mozilla
platform. All elements of Instantbird are customizable, from the message
theme itself (we&#8217;ve built on the great message style format used in
Adium) to the Instantbird theme, user interface and protocols. There are
already over 250 add-ons available, here are some of our&nbsp;favorites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/248">Colorize</a>
&#8212; change a buddy&#8217;s color in a private conversation based on their&nbsp;name</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/250">Highlight</a>
&#8212; be notified of certain words in a chat as if they were your&nbsp;nickname</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/276">Tab
Complete</a>
&#8212; tab completion of nicknames and&nbsp;commands</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/249">Reply to
Nick</a>
&#8212; allows easy replying: double clicking a message in the chat
inserts the sender&#8217;s name in the message input&nbsp;box</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/251">Show
Nick</a>
&#8212; colors the nicknames in messages in multi-user&nbsp;chats</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/244">Vertical
Tabs</a>
&#8212; too many conversations open? Move the tabs from horizontal to&nbsp;vertical!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="respecting-users">
<h2>Respecting&nbsp;users</h2>
<p>As part of our belief in <strong>respecting our users</strong>, we give them an
<strong>ad-free experience</strong> and respect their privacy by not collecting any
information about them (Instantbird contacts our servers only when
checking for updates, or in the unfortunate and uncommon event of a&nbsp;crash).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-us">
<h2>About&nbsp;us</h2>
<p>The Instantbird team is a group of volunteers who are passionate about
empowering instant messaging users by providing a stable, fun instant
messenger. Read more about <a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/about.html">who we
are</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.org/">our core beliefs and
values</a>.</p>
<p>While Instantbird has received invaluable support from the Mozilla
community at large, it hasn&#8217;t been funded in any way by the Mozilla
Foundation. The company-quality infrastructure deployed to build and
support Instantbird has been funded by the initial creators who strongly
believe in the importance of this project. The increasingly fast growth
of Instantbird&#8217;s user base leads us to believe the project could find
some user-respecting revenue streams from which the project could become
economically sustainable and empower the non-profit created for it to
start hiring key contributors, following a model similar to what Mozilla
has been doing with&nbsp;Firefox.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank all of our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/thanks.html">contributors and
translators</a> who have helped
build Instantbird. In addition, we&#8217;d also like to thank our invaluable
beta and nightly testers who provide timely bug reports and help track
down&nbsp;regressions!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <div class="section" id="the-current-system">
<h2>The current&nbsp;system</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the Instantbird project, we have released
versions numbered <tt class="docutils literal">0.x.y.z</tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">0.</tt> indicates that the initial goals of the project haven&#8217;t been
reached&nbsp;yet.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> is the major version number. For example, Instantbird 0.2 was a
major version for which we made very significant&nbsp;changes.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> is the minor version number, incremented when a release is very
similar to the previous one, but with some new features. We released
Instantbird 0.1.1, 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 which were minor new&nbsp;versions.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">z</tt> was used only for emergency bugfix releases. For example we
released 0.1.2.1 a day after 0.1.2 because of a very common crash on
Windows with some <span class="caps">MSN</span> accounts (not those we used during our testing
of course). We also released Instantbird 0.1.3.1 when Instantbird
0.1.3 was no longer able to connect to the <span class="caps">ICQ</span>&nbsp;network.</li>
</ul>
<p>This version numbering scheme made a lot of sense when the project was
initially a &#8220;<span class="caps">XUL</span> <span class="caps">UI</span> for Pidgin&#8221; and the goal was to reach &#8220;feature
parity&#8221; with Pidgin for Instantbird 1.0. We have, however, supported
features that Pidgin doesn&#8217;t have for a long time, thus defining the
completion of Instantbird 1.0 as a comparison with Pidgin doesn&#8217;t make
sense any more. Actually, our roadmap has stated for a long time already
that the 1.0 goal is a &#8220;Simple, usable and extensible user&nbsp;interface.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the 0.x.y.z version number, we are using &#8220;aN&#8221; and &#8220;bN&#8221;
suffixes for alpha and beta releases (0.3b1 for example), so the version
number in itself has nothing to do with stability (actually, our testers
report that even our nightly builds are stable!). 0.&lt;something&gt; only
means that we haven&#8217;t reached our initial goals, not that the version
isn&#8217;t&nbsp;stable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="received-feedback">
<h2>Received&nbsp;feedback</h2>
<p>While linux enthusiasts are used to have great software with a
not-yet-1.0 version number, on Windows a 0.* version number was a bit
misleading and we received mostly 2 kinds of feedback about the version&nbsp;number:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Wow, I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s so stable and featureful with such a low
version number!&#8221; (user who has downloaded and tested&nbsp;it)</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oh, it looks cool, but with such a low version number, it&#8217;s a
pre-alpha, it can&#8217;t be stable, I&#8217;ll give it a try when it reaches&nbsp;1.0.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Disappointing, isn&#8217;t it? <img alt=";-)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/clin_d'oeil.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next">
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>We are about to release Instantbird 0.3. This is a major version of
Instantbird, with more changes than any previous release. With the
current changes in the Mozilla release cycle, we are very unlikely to
ever release again a version containing so many changes at once (more
details on how we will adapt to release much more frequently in the
future in another post soon after the release). When releasing
Instantbird 0.2, we hesitated between incrementing the major version
number by only one (which is what we did), or skipping a few version
numbers to go straight to 0.5, because we felt we were half way through
on our goals of delivering a simple, easy to use, cross-platform,
multi-protocol, extensible instant messaging application. After the
fact, given the feedback related to the low version number that we
received, we regretted that we didn&#8217;t go ahead and release it as
Instantbird&nbsp;0.5.</p>
<p>What we called Instantbird 0.3 up to now is most likely the last major
release in which we change important things in every parts of the code
base at once. We don&#8217;t feel that we&#8217;re only &#8220;half way through&#8221;, so this
time we won&#8217;t have regrets: It&#8217;s going to be released as <strong>Instantbird
1.0</strong>.&nbsp;Tomorrow!</p>

requirements of the <span class="caps">IM</span> networks you&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Similarly, click the &#8220;Display name&#8221; place holder to edit it. This name
will be visible in your contacts&#8217; buddy lists (unfortunately this
currently works only for <span class="caps">MSN</span>).</p>
<p>Here you go, your friends will now easily recognize&nbsp;you:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of the contact list with an icon and a display name" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIcon.png" /></p>
<p>Conversation windows have also been changed to display your contacts&#8217;
icons and some more information (display name, status message,&nbsp;&#8230;):</p>
<p><img alt="conversation with an info bar showing the user icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconConvUI.png" /></p>
<p>I can already hear some comments about how much space this new
information bar takes (or wastes) in all conversation windows. Yes,
this takes a lot of space, we know. People tend to use big or very big
windows for chatting (sometimes even full screen!) but if you like the
ability to chat in small windows, don&#8217;t worry, we love you too! Just
resize the window and this information bar will shrink to ensure you
still see the actual content of the&nbsp;conversation:</p>
<p><img alt="conversation with a smaller info bar" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconSmallConvUI.png" /></p>
<p>And for very small conversation windows, the bar will completely
disappear, leaving only the strictly necessary user&nbsp;interface:</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The contact list was identified as a weak area of Instantbird 0.2. It
has been dramatically improved for Instantbird 0.3 which we plan to
release next&nbsp;week.</p>
<div class="section" id="tags">
<h2>Tags</h2>
<div class="section" id="goodbye-groups">
<h3>Goodbye&nbsp;groups</h3>
<p>Like most <span class="caps">IM</span> clients, Instantbird 0.2 had each contact placed in a
group, leading users to organize contacts a bit like files are placed in
folders on the&nbsp;disk.</p>
<p>While this seems ok at first, placing contacts inside groups doesn&#8217;t
work well when thinking of the contact as a person. Don&#8217;t you have a
friend (group &#8216;friend&#8217;) who is also a coworker (group&nbsp;&#8216;colleagues&#8217;)?</p>
<p>For this reason, with Instantbird 0.3 we replaced the notion of
&#8220;Groups&#8221; with the notion of &#8220;Tags&#8221; throughout the user interface.
While groups used to be containers for your contacts (it was possible
to move a contact from one group into another), tags are additional
data attached to the contact (you can add or remove tags on a contact,
but no longer &#8216;move&#8217; a contact) and thus a single contact can have
multiple tags. To change the tags attached to a contact, use the
&#8220;Tags&#8230;&#8221; context menu item of the contact; it shows a list of the
existing tags with a check mark next to the tags attached to the
selected contact. Checking/unchecking a tag in this list will
attach/detach a tag from the&nbsp;contact.</p>
<p><img alt="Tags menu" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/tags-menu.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hidden-tags">
<h3>Hidden&nbsp;tags</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty common when using several accounts of different protocols on
a multi-protocol client for the first time to have contacts scattered
around in lots of meaningless tags. These contacts are typically those
that have never been moved before and are still in whatever the default
group of the various previous clients&nbsp;were.</p>
<p>As moving each of these contacts out of these meaningless groups is
not really an interesting task, and sometimes is even impossible (if
the server doesn&#8217;t allow us to move it), we have designed a more
efficient way to forget the annoyance caused by the pointless
resulting tags: when hovering a tag in the contact list, you will see
an [x] icon. Clicking it will hide the tag (after showing an
explanation the first&nbsp;time).</p>
<p><img alt="Hide tag icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/hide-tag-button.png" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to manage the list of visible tags (to unhide a tag) from
the &#8220;Visible tags&#8230;&#8221; context menu&nbsp;item.</p>
<p>Contacts which haven&#8217;t been associated with a visible tag will be
displayed in a special &#8220;Other Contacts&#8221; tag, always at the bottom of the
contact&nbsp;list.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grouped-contacts">
<h2>Grouped&nbsp;contacts</h2>
<p>If several networks are usable to <span class="caps">IM</span> the same person, you will no longer
be annoyed by seeing that person listed several times in your contact
list. Just drag and drop one of these contacts onto another and
Instantbird will know they are both ways to contact the same&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>During future conversations, if your contact suddenly starts talking to
you from a different network, the conversation will continue in the same
tab. A system message will be displayed in the conversation to
unobtrusively notify you of this&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>If you want to start talking to a different account of your contact,
you can do so easily with a click on the protocol icon at the top
right of the conversation <span class="caps">UI</span>:</p>
<p><img alt="Talk using a different network" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/conversation-targets-menu.png" /></p>
<p>When starting a conversation from the contact list, Instantbird will
automatically select the best way to reach your contact, based on
availability information and your preference with regard to the
various ways to contact this person. You can change this preference by
expanding a contact (with the down arrow icon) and then using drag and
drop to reorder the&nbsp;accounts.</p>
<p><img alt="Expanded contact" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/expanded-contact.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-noticable-changes">
<h2>Other noticable&nbsp;changes</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The contact list is now sorted: both tags and contacts inside a tag
appear alphabetically&nbsp;sorted.</li>
<li>Changes in the displayed information are smoothly animated, making
them at the same time easier to understand and less&nbsp;interrupting.</li>
<li>Closing the contact list window, which is not needed all the time,
will no longer close Instantbird. On Windows and Linux it will be
minimized to the system tray (this behavior can be customized in the
Preference dialog); on Mac it can be easily reopened from the&nbsp;menubar.</li>
</ul>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2011/06/introducing-magic-copy/" rel="bookmark">Introducing magic&nbsp;copy</a></h1>
  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The surprise and enthusiasm of a few people about the &#8220;magic copy&#8221;
feature I mentioned briefly at the end of <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/articles/introducing-time-bubbles.rst">my previous post</a>
introducing time bubbles reminded me that we forgot to introduce this
feature when it landed for Instantbird 0.2 as part of our implementation
of <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/articles/instantbird-0-2-feature-preview-conversations-customization.rst">the Adium message theme system</a>.</p>
<p>We decided to use this theme system because it seemed nice overall and
was already used by a few other clients as well. However there was
something we really didn&#8217;t like: using a customized message theme could
make copied data from the conversation really hard to read, to the point
that it would be unsuitable for sending a quote via&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>As this may not be very clear yet, let me give an&nbsp;example:</p>
<p><img alt="Copying from a conversation without the 'magic copy' feature" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-normal.png" /></p>
<p>This is the text we get when copying the selection to the clipboard and
pasting it. This is without our &#8220;magic copy&#8221; feature of&nbsp;course.</p>
<p>I should also note that the Bubbles theme used for this screenshot is
not the worst in this regards. I&#8217;ve seen in the description of some
themes (not designed for Instantbird) that they were &#8220;clipboard
friendly&#8221;, which indicates the theme author took this problem into
account and probably had to make some trade-offs between the visual
appearance and the usability of copied&nbsp;conversations.</p>
<p>As we were not satisfied with this situation (which either makes copying
from the conversation poorly usable or restricts theme authors&#8217;
creativity), we developed a different system that instead of serializing
the selected <span class="caps">HTML</span> attempts to detect which messages are selected, and to
&#8220;prettyprint&#8221; them based on what Instantbird knows about the message,
rather than what is visible and&nbsp;selected.</p>
<p>This is the&nbsp;result:</p>
<p><img alt="Same conversation copied with magic copy" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-magic.png" /></p>
<p>If only a part of a single message was selected, the username and
timestamp won&#8217;t be added to the copied strings, it will behave like a
normal text&nbsp;copy:</p>
<p><img alt="Copying a part of a single message" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-part-of-one-message.png" /></p>
<p>As we detect which messages are selected and even know if each message
was fully selected or only in part, we can nicely add an ellipsis when
a message was&nbsp;cut:</p>
<p><img alt="Ellipsis are added where messages are cut" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-ellipsis.png" /></p>
<p>This even works when using multiple-selections (press Ctrl on
Windows/Linux, and Command on Mac to do&nbsp;this):</p>
<p><img alt="Copying parts of multiple messages" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-multi-select.png" /></p>
<p>A few technical details: the template used to serialize copied messages
is both localizable and customizable from <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a>, it&#8217;s also
possible to completely turn off this feature in case it ever causes some
trouble (look for the <tt class="docutils literal">messenger.conversations.selections.*</tt> family of
preferences in <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a>).</p>
<p>This feature has been turned on by default in Instantbird for over a
year and nobody complained about it. Actually, it&#8217;s one of the features
that is barely noticed because it just works, but it is something that
is really missed if using another <span class="caps">IM</span> client after using Instantbird for
a&nbsp;while.</p>

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the release of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html">Instantbird 0.3
beta</a>, the first
localized preview of what we have been working on for months, available
in 10 locales (Czech, German, English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Polish,
Russian, Slovak and&nbsp;Ukrainian)!</p>
<p>In addition to the cool features already introduced in the previous two
alpha releases (among which the Twitter support, tags, contacts merging,
&#8230;), this beta brings significant appearance changes with user icons,
an updated tab style, the <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/articles/introducing-time-bubbles.rst">improved default message theme</a>,
Aero glass effects on Windows and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html">more</a> awesome new&nbsp;features!</p>
<p>As <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html">Instantbird 0.3</a>
is almost finished and already localized, thanks to the great work of
our localizers who were eager to share Instantbird with people speaking
their language, this beta release is a great opportunity to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html">give
Instantbird a try</a>,
play with it, and <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/">report bugs</a>!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.3b1.html">Download Instantbird 0.3 beta
now</a>!</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your feedback to help us make the final
Instantbird 0.3 release (planned for this month!) a piece of software
you will want to share with all your&nbsp;friends!</p>
