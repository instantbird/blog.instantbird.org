  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Exactly 4 years after the very early 0.1 preview, Instantbird 1.1 has
just been released today in 13 locales (Swedish and Estonian are&nbsp;new)!</p>
<p>In addition to several stability fixes and a dramatic reduction of
resource consumption in some cases, this new release will make Twitter
and <span class="caps">IRC</span> much more usable in&nbsp;Instantbird:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On Twitter, it&#8217;s now possible from the context menu to <strong>retweet</strong>,
to <strong>reply to a tweet</strong> (or simply double click on the tweet to start
a reply). The context menu also lets you follow or unfollow the
author of the&nbsp;tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Tab completion</strong> of usernames (starting with an &#64; character on
twitter) or nicknames (in <span class="caps">IRC</span> channels) will also be very&nbsp;appreciated.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these changes have been commonly requested, so no surprise here. But
there&#8217;s one last feature I would like to talk about before offering you
a download link: Instantbird 1.1 brings support for putting conversation
on hold. This means you can now <strong>close conversation tabs without
leaving the conversation</strong>, the conversation will sit at the top of the
Contacts window until you reopen it or someone talks to you. While this
may seem like a small change, it&#8217;s exceptionally useful for <span class="caps">IRC</span> users
who tend to idle in lots of channels because they want to &#8220;be there just
in case&#8221; but don&#8217;t interact much with the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Enough talk! Time to go <a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/">download Instantbird
1.1</a> (or read the <a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/release-notes.html">more detailed release
notes</a>).</p>
<p>As always, your feedback is welcome! And if you like Instantbird, maybe
you will want to share the good news with your friends on
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.instantbird.com/">Facebook</a>

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For Instantbird 1.1, which will be released soon, we realized a weak
spot in our <span class="caps">API</span> was the ability to control whether events should be
shown to a user or cancelled under certain conditions.&nbsp; This fits in as
part of our mission about giving control of instant messaging to the
user: the user should only be interrupted by events that deserve their
attention.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re wondering how this is useful; extensions now have
great control over how Instantbird is allowed to interact with the
user.&nbsp; For example, extensions could: keep conversations from opening
(i.e. spam guards), quiet sounds during a full screen video, or even
stop new conversations from opening if the user has set their status as&nbsp;Unavailable.</p>
<p>Extensions are able to simply register themselves with the interruptions
manager and they will automatically be notified if certain events
happen, including when Instantbird wants to: get your attention (e.g.
flash the task bar), open a new conversation, play a sound or show a
message&nbsp;notification.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">API</span> is really easy to use and we&#8217;ve created some example add-ons
that use it!&nbsp; We have created an an add-on to not allow the NickServ
from <span class="caps">IRC</span> accounts to open
(<a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/addons/file/015cf6b699bc/nickservkiller">source</a>),
an update of
<a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/209">NickServKiller</a>.
Additionally there is an add-on to force auto-joined chats to be held on
the buddy list
(<a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/addons/file/015cf6b699bc/hideautojoins">source</a>),
allowing you to give them your attention when you want to.&nbsp; Another
example of a great add-on is the Do Not Disturb add-on, which does not
allow Instantbird to disturb the user while their status is set to
Unavailable, really allowing you to concentrate on something more
important
(<a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/addons/file/ca4ba6af0b8a/donotdisturb">source</a>).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a skeleton for an anti-spam add-on (an often requested
feature!) that is just waiting to be finished!&nbsp; Contact us on
<a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/instantbird">#instantbird on irc.mozilla.org</a>
if you&#8217;re interested in helping out.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t worry, these extensions
will be available on
<a class="reference external" href="http://addons.instantbird.org">addons.instantbird.org</a>&nbsp;soon!</p>
<p>We think this is a great addition for add-on developers working on
Instantbird and can&#8217;t wait to see what exciting ideas people come up&nbsp;with!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Following the release of Instantbird 1.0, we&#8217;ve received a variety of
great feedback (if you haven&#8217;t read some of our other posts: we love to
receive feedback, although we might not always agree) via our <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/instantbird-contact/topics">contact
email
address</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/instantbird">our <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel</a>, our <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/">bug
tracker</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/instantbird">Twitter</a> and what ever other ways
there are to communicate with us. We&#8217;d like to take some time to respond
to some of the popular requests we&#8217;ve got (or at the very least, point
you to the bug where you can follow any&nbsp;progress).</p>
<p><strong>File transfer support</strong>: something we definitely want, but we also
want to give a good user experience. Unfortunately most protocols do not
transfer files efficiently or quickly (and many times they break when
behind firewalls, etc.), thus we wish to offer an alternative to using
the protocol file transfer before providing support for it: see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9">bug
9</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Grouping buddies first by protocol then by group</strong>: this has been
requested by multiple individuals, but we don&#8217;t feel it would fit well
into Instantbird. Instantbird is a multi-protocol instant messaging
client that aims to integrate all of your accounts together (therefore
it doesn&#8217;t make sense to separate your accounts on the contact&nbsp;list).</p>
<p>For example, is your &#8220;Friend&#8221; not your friend whether it&#8217;s your <span class="caps">MSN</span>
account, your <span class="caps">AIM</span> account or your Facebook account? Of course they still
are! But perhaps you have different groups of friends on <span class="caps">MSN</span> than on <span class="caps">AIM</span>
(maybe one is your online gaming buddies and one is your high school
friends); well our suggestion is to move them to tags that make more
sense (i.e. make an &#8220;Online Gaming Buddies&#8221; tag for all your <span class="caps">MSN</span> friends
and a &#8220;School Friends&#8221; tag for all your <span class="caps">AIM</span> friends, in this&nbsp;example).</p>
<p>When asking people why they want this, the response usually is &#8220;that&#8217;s
what &lt;another <span class="caps">IM</span> client&gt; does&#8221;. Well, ok but we wish that you take more
of a &#8216;contact level view&#8217; of people: <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/articles/better-contact-list.rst">Combine your contacts that are the
same person</a> and
group them according to how you know them. (You can even put them in
multiple tags, if someone is your online gaming buddy <span class="caps">AND</span> from&nbsp;school!)</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a usecase that we&#8217;re not covering here, please let us know!
(And don&#8217;t forget that Instantbird is fully extensible, so you could
certainly write an extension to display the contacts grouped first by
protocol if you really need that&nbsp;feature.)</p>
<p><strong>Blocking buddies at the protocol level</strong>: unfortunately support for
this isn&#8217;t great depending on the protocol, but libpurple does support
it. We have two bugs on file; one is to <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135">block individual
users</a> and
another to <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704">block all buddies not on your buddy
list</a>, which
might not be supported by all&nbsp;protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Blocking spam</strong>: although this is similar to blocking buddies, it&#8217;s
different in that you do not wish to block <span class="caps">ALL</span> people not on your buddy
list, but of course you still want to ignore the obvious spam messages!
See <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288">bug 288</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=887">bug 887</a>
for two ideas on how to implement&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>Start with the operating system</strong>: many people expect an <span class="caps">IM</span> client to
start with their operating system and although most operating systems
provide a way to manually make a program start on boot, it would be
convenient for Instantbird to provide an option to do this. This was
requested in <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376">bug
376</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook &#8220;Not Authorized&#8221; error</strong>: we added the solution to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/faq.html#facebookauthorization"><span class="caps">FAQ</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Voice/video</strong>: we&#8217;d love to support voice/video too! But libpurple
does not yet support voice/video on Windows or Mac, you can see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=568">bug
568</a> for some
information on how we could support it in JavaScript&nbsp;protocols.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">OTR</span> (off the record messaging)</strong>: private messaging is something we
believe is useful, but it needs to be convenient and transparent to the
users (after authentication, of course!). Encrypted chat is not a
trivial task, especially when the protocols don&#8217;t support it, but
there&#8217;s a library (called Off the Record) which handles this for us, we
have a bug about integrating it: <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=877">bug
877</a>.</p>
<p><strong>People want 64-bit Linux versions</strong>: we actually currently <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.instantbird.org/instantbird/releases/1.0/contrib/">supply
unsupported 64-bit
builds</a>,
and there&#8217;s a bug about making them official (<a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395">bug
395</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Instantbird interrupts you</strong>: if you receive a new <span class="caps">IM</span> window
Instantbird rudely pops to the front, this is mostly noticeable when
using another application as a fullscreen window (<a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=926">bug
926</a>). Luckily
for now, there&#8217;s currently an easy workaround: keep a conversation
window opened and minimized, so that a new conversation appears in a tab
of the existing window instead of a new&nbsp;window.</p>
<p><strong>Being able to search/filter the contacts</strong> would be helpful: we agree!
In fact we filed a bug about it: <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631">bug
631</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of positive feedback! Including that Instantbird works great with
screen readers! We&#8217;ve received <span class="caps">TONS</span> of other great feedback as well,
this is just a summary of the popular feedback we&#8217;ve&nbsp;received.</p>
<p>Please remember that one of the team&#8217;s goals is to keep Instantbird as
light as possible, and for that reason, we are trying to encourage the
idea of creating add-ons for things that may not seem as a core
necessity for the larger&nbsp;audience.</p>
<p>Development of Instantbird 1.1 is already well underway. We have a
tentative
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Roadmap:1.1">roadmap</a> for
it. We definitely plan to release faster than we used to do before
Instantbird 1.0. Our current target date for the next release is the end
of&nbsp;September!</p>

  <header class="entry-header">
    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2011/07/why-should-i-switch-from-pidgin/" rel="bookmark"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Why should I switch from&nbsp;Pidgin?&#8221;</a></h1>
  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This is a question people keep asking us. With some variations (&#8220;Why
should I switch from Adium?&#8221;), or sometimes without the question mark
(&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more than&nbsp;Pidgin&#8221;).</p>
<div class="section" id="we-are-not-competing">
<h2>We are not&nbsp;competing&#8230;</h2>
<p>I think people ask us this question because they perceive us as
competing with Pidgin/Adium/[insert the name of your favorite open
source <span class="caps">IM</span> client]. But there&#8217;s no good answer to that question, because
we are not competing, here is&nbsp;why:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we share values. We believe that instant messaging technologies
should be freely accessible and open: people should not be locked in
closed&nbsp;systems.</li>
<li>we share a technology stand point: we think that to empower people to
increasingly use the open <span class="caps">IM</span> technologies that we like, we need to
offer people a tool that makes it easy to access both promising open
technologies and legacy&nbsp;networks.</li>
<li>we share code. Instantbird, like Adium, relies on libpurple, which is
at the heart of Pidgin, to connect to legacy networks. We take this
code, but we also give back: several changes made to libpurple to
improve its reliability in Instantbird are now part of Pidgin. We are
working together, and Instantbird developers are definitely part of
the Pidgin developer&nbsp;community.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-we-offer-an-alternative">
<h2>&#8230; but we offer an&nbsp;alternative</h2>
<p>I can easily understand why people think we compete though, as we do
provide an alternative. I assume people who ask the previously mentioned
question actually wanted the answer to another question: How is
Instantbird different from Pidgin? Now, this is a question we can&nbsp;answer!</p>
<p>I will actually provide several different answers: the first will
satisfy technically oriented people, the others should be understandable
by everybody. Most of my points compares Instantbird to Pidgin, but are
still applicable when comparing Instantbird to other <span class="caps">IM</span>&nbsp;clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-differences">
<h2>Technical&nbsp;differences</h2>
<p>The biggest technical difference between Pidgin and Instantbird is that
Pidgin uses <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ and Instantbird uses the Mozilla <span class="caps">XUL</span> platform to
display its user&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>The Mozilla platform has advantages compared to <span class="caps">GTK</span>+:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Mozilla platform is well known for its awesome extensibility.
Add-ons can modify almost anything that is part of the Instantbird
user interface, and the skills required to build add-ons are similar
to the skills required to create a website, as the technologies are
basically the same: <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, JavaScript, <span class="caps">XML</span>, &#8230; Instantbird
add-ons are easy to install, some can even be installed without
restarting the application! (To be fair, Pidgin also supports
plugins, but writing them in C requires much more programming
knowledge and to compile them for each platform. Pidgin also has
Python (via D-Bus) and Perl scripting APIs, but I&#8217;m not sure they are
actually usable on&nbsp;Windows.)</li>
<li>While a <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ user interface is native on some Linux desktop operating
systems (typically those based on Gnome or <span class="caps">XFCE</span>), a <span class="caps">XUL</span> user
interface also acts native on Windows (we even included some Aero
Glass effects for Windows 7) and Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X where <span class="caps">GTK</span> may not fit as&nbsp;well.</li>
<li>Thanks to the Mozilla accessibility effort, the <span class="caps">XUL</span> platform is very
accessible and we have received a lot of enthusiastic feedback from
users of assistive technologies who love&nbsp;Instantbird.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing on top of Mozilla also has some (perceived)&nbsp;downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We need to ship the whole Mozilla toolkit, which makes us package
megabytes of compiled code we didn&#8217;t write. This means for example
that the Instantbird installer for Windows weights 9.<span class="caps">9MB</span>. Some people
(especially some Miranda fans) seem to think this is huge, but while
I like to find ways to reduce the size of the installer we ship, I
tend to think at this point it is mostly a non-issue. Just for
comparison, the Pidgin installer weights 9.<span class="caps">5MB</span> without <span class="caps">GTK</span>, and
32.<span class="caps">4MB</span> with all its dependencies&nbsp;included.</li>
<li>The Mozilla platform has the reputation of using more resources than
other browsers/toolkits. The good news is, some bright people are
currently making a <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/MemShrink">huge
effort</a> to reduce
the memory usage, so this will be mitigated in future releases. Plus
the situation is not as bad as some people pretend it to be: the
memory usage measurements we see in comments about Instantbird aren&#8217;t
that scary, some people start to complain when an application uses
<span class="caps">40MB</span> of memory. Hey come on, we are in 2011, new machines have been
shipping with gigabytes of memory for years&nbsp;already&#8230;</li>
<li>I heard from some Linux packagers that the Mozilla build system is
not easy to work with for them. While there may be some pain points
here, it doesn&#8217;t really affect the end&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-make-instantbird-for-you">
<h2>We make Instantbird for&nbsp;you!</h2>
<p>Some developers make their programs the best for themselves and share it
with you, for free. These programs are the result of people&#8217;s hard work
which they offer you as a gift, and so these people deserve respect for
that! Unfortunately, it is not unusual that if somehow the product
doesn&#8217;t work out for you, it&#8217;s your problem, not theirs, and you are
free: to fix it, to report the issue and hope someone will fix it, or to
look for a greener pasture. Your comments are valued if they help
developers make their program better for everybody, for example if it
helps fixing bugs that lots of people suffer from. Your opinions and
wishes may not be taken into account, however, unless you intend to
actually start working on them: patches are welcome, not additional work
(people are busy&nbsp;already).</p>
<p>We work to make Instantbird the best for you. We look forward to
gathering your feedback and acting upon it to make Instantbird even
better, for you. We assume that when someone takes the trouble to come
and talk with us to complain about something, there&#8217;s a valid concern.
Even when it&#8217;s well hidden behind factually inexact assertions that we
can&#8217;t agree with. If people cannot express themselves clearly, there&#8217;s a
reason why they are confused, and if a confusion is common, we should
find its cause and fix&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>As this difference may be a bit theoretical, I&#8217;m going to give a
concrete example in the next point: the way we deal with stability&nbsp;issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stability">
<h2>Stability</h2>
<div class="section" id="crash-reports">
<h3>Crash&nbsp;reports</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens in the unfortunate event of the user being hit by
a bug resulting in a crash of the&nbsp;application:</p>
<p>If you are using Pidgin and want to help get the bug fixed, you need to
<a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/GetABacktrace">get a backtrace</a> (on
Unix systems) or to have <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/TipsForBugReports#WhattodoifPidgincrashes">installed the debug symbols before the
crash</a>
so that a crash report could be dumped to the disk (on Windows). Then
you need to open a ticket on trac and give all the info you have. As
this process may be a bit scary for most end-users, I&#8217;m afraid valuable
feedback could get&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>If the same issue happens with Instantbird, first we&nbsp;apologize:</p>
<p><img alt="Instantbird crash reporter" src="http://blog.instantbird.org/images/crash-breakpad.png" /></p>
<p>Then all you have to do to send us the technical information about the
crash is a single click in this crash reporter dialog. We collect all
these crash reports and analyze them to improve the stability of the
next version of&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nightly-testing">
<h3>Nightly&nbsp;testing</h3>
<p>In addition to collecting crash reports, another thing we do to maintain
a high stability level for Instantbird is that we encourage early
adopters to run with nightly builds of Instantbird which are updated
almost daily with the very latest version of our source code. Therefore,
if something we changed degrades the stability, we receive crash reports
way before the defective change ends up in a release you may&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>If some change feels a bit risky to us, we push it to our testers at
least a week before releasing, or we delay it so that it gets
appropriate testing before being included in the next&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>Just as a comparison, Pidgin&#8217;s currently in development code is tested
only by developers and <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Installing%20Pidgin#WhydoyoualwayssaynottouseMTN">others people are discouraged from attempting to
use
it</a>.</p>
<p>Learn more about our <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/articles/stability.rst">stability efforts</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changing">
<h2>Changing</h2>
<p>We keep seeing comments of people (who have not actually tried
Instantbird) who think we should go improve Pidgin instead of &#8220;wasting
time&#8221; on&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
<p>In the page of our website where we explain <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/">why we create
Instantbird</a>, we&nbsp;conclude:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="compound">
<p>It&#8217;s time to bring back&nbsp;innovation!</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>To do this, we need to be able to change things easily. As Instantbird
is still a young project, we can change&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>Pidgin on the other hand is already a mature project with policies about
when it&#8217;s acceptable to change APIs or when they are frozen: it&#8217;s
basically impossible to change an <span class="caps">API</span> in Pidgin until a new major
version is released (so after the Pidgin 2.0.0 release, the <span class="caps">API</span> changes
have to wait until Pidgin 3.0.0 comes out to be included: currently
Pidgin 2.0.0 was released over four years ago!). This is a good thing to
ensure the plugins stay compatible, but it slows down the changes to the&nbsp;application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="different-feature-sets">
<h2>Different feature&nbsp;sets</h2>
<p>This is my last point even though most people would expect to see it
first. Instantbird and Pidgin have different feature&nbsp;sets.</p>
<p>On one hand, Pidgin has some features that Instantbird doesn&#8217;t have.
Some that we will have in the future. Some that we don&#8217;t want to have.
I&#8217;m not going to give a full list here because I don&#8217;t actually have a
list of all Pidgin features to compare and check what we have and what
we don&#8217;t have. We are neither trying to copy Pidgin nor to directly
compete against it, so such a list would be irrelevant&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Instantbird has some features that Pidgin doesn&#8217;t
have (message themes, automatic updates, inline search, &#8230;) and even
some unique features (for two examples, see my blog posts introducing
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/articles/introducing-time-bubbles.rst">Time Bubbles</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.instantbird.org/articles/introducing-magic-copy.rst">Magic copy</a>).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, should you switch to Instantbird? If I were you, I would. But I&#8217;m
not you. Deciding which <span class="caps">IM</span> client you use is your choice, based on your
taste, your needs, your feelings. It&#8217;s your decision,&nbsp;really!</p>
<p>If you like what you currently have and see nothing you like in what
Instantbird offers, just keep using what you&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>If you love Instantbird, then, obviously you should use&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If you are in the middle and like Instantbird but for some reason can&#8217;t
use it because something you really need is missing or doesn&#8217;t work,
please tell us about it, we are eager to receive your feedback! And
maybe there&#8217;s already an add-on to customize Instantbird to do what you
wanted that we can point you&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>In any case, we are not going to try to force you to switch from Pidgin
or whatever <span class="caps">IM</span> client you may be using right now to Instantbird. We
respect your freedom, we respect your choices, we love&nbsp;you!</p>
