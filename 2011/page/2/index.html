    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2011/07/why-should-i-switch-from-pidgin/" rel="bookmark"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Why should I switch from&nbsp;Pidgin?&#8221;</a></h1>
  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This is a question people keep asking us. With some variations (&#8220;Why
should I switch from Adium?&#8221;), or sometimes without the question mark
(&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more than&nbsp;Pidgin&#8221;).</p>
<div class="section" id="we-are-not-competing">
<h2>We are not&nbsp;competing&#8230;</h2>
<p>I think people ask us this question because they perceive us as
competing with Pidgin/Adium/[insert the name of your favorite open
source <span class="caps">IM</span> client]. But there&#8217;s no good answer to that question, because
we are not competing, here is&nbsp;why:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we share values. We believe that instant messaging technologies
should be freely accessible and open: people should not be locked in
closed&nbsp;systems.</li>
<li>we share a technology stand point: we think that to empower people to
increasingly use the open <span class="caps">IM</span> technologies that we like, we need to
offer people a tool that makes it easy to access both promising open
technologies and legacy&nbsp;networks.</li>
<li>we share code. Instantbird, like Adium, relies on libpurple, which is
at the heart of Pidgin, to connect to legacy networks. We take this
code, but we also give back: several changes made to libpurple to
improve its reliability in Instantbird are now part of Pidgin. We are
working together, and Instantbird developers are definitely part of
the Pidgin developer&nbsp;community.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-we-offer-an-alternative">
<h2>&#8230; but we offer an&nbsp;alternative</h2>
<p>I can easily understand why people think we compete though, as we do
provide an alternative. I assume people who ask the previously mentioned
question actually wanted the answer to another question: How is
Instantbird different from Pidgin? Now, this is a question we can&nbsp;answer!</p>
<p>I will actually provide several different answers: the first will
satisfy technically oriented people, the others should be understandable
by everybody. Most of my points compares Instantbird to Pidgin, but are
still applicable when comparing Instantbird to other <span class="caps">IM</span>&nbsp;clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-differences">
<h2>Technical&nbsp;differences</h2>
<p>The biggest technical difference between Pidgin and Instantbird is that
Pidgin uses <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ and Instantbird uses the Mozilla <span class="caps">XUL</span> platform to
display its user&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>The Mozilla platform has advantages compared to <span class="caps">GTK</span>+:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Mozilla platform is well known for its awesome extensibility.
Add-ons can modify almost anything that is part of the Instantbird
user interface, and the skills required to build add-ons are similar
to the skills required to create a website, as the technologies are
basically the same: <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, JavaScript, <span class="caps">XML</span>, &#8230; Instantbird
add-ons are easy to install, some can even be installed without
restarting the application! (To be fair, Pidgin also supports
plugins, but writing them in C requires much more programming
knowledge and to compile them for each platform. Pidgin also has
Python (via D-Bus) and Perl scripting APIs, but I&#8217;m not sure they are
actually usable on&nbsp;Windows.)</li>
<li>While a <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ user interface is native on some Linux desktop operating
systems (typically those based on Gnome or <span class="caps">XFCE</span>), a <span class="caps">XUL</span> user
interface also acts native on Windows (we even included some Aero
Glass effects for Windows 7) and Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X where <span class="caps">GTK</span> may not fit as&nbsp;well.</li>
<li>Thanks to the Mozilla accessibility effort, the <span class="caps">XUL</span> platform is very
accessible and we have received a lot of enthusiastic feedback from
users of assistive technologies who love&nbsp;Instantbird.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing on top of Mozilla also has some (perceived)&nbsp;downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We need to ship the whole Mozilla toolkit, which makes us package
megabytes of compiled code we didn&#8217;t write. This means for example
that the Instantbird installer for Windows weights 9.<span class="caps">9MB</span>. Some people
(especially some Miranda fans) seem to think this is huge, but while
I like to find ways to reduce the size of the installer we ship, I
tend to think at this point it is mostly a non-issue. Just for
comparison, the Pidgin installer weights 9.<span class="caps">5MB</span> without <span class="caps">GTK</span>, and
32.<span class="caps">4MB</span> with all its dependencies&nbsp;included.</li>
<li>The Mozilla platform has the reputation of using more resources than
other browsers/toolkits. The good news is, some bright people are
currently making a <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/MemShrink">huge
effort</a> to reduce
the memory usage, so this will be mitigated in future releases. Plus
the situation is not as bad as some people pretend it to be: the
memory usage measurements we see in comments about Instantbird aren&#8217;t
that scary, some people start to complain when an application uses
<span class="caps">40MB</span> of memory. Hey come on, we are in 2011, new machines have been
shipping with gigabytes of memory for years&nbsp;already&#8230;</li>
<li>I heard from some Linux packagers that the Mozilla build system is
not easy to work with for them. While there may be some pain points
here, it doesn&#8217;t really affect the end&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-make-instantbird-for-you">
<h2>We make Instantbird for&nbsp;you!</h2>
<p>Some developers make their programs the best for themselves and share it
with you, for free. These programs are the result of people&#8217;s hard work
which they offer you as a gift, and so these people deserve respect for
that! Unfortunately, it is not unusual that if somehow the product
doesn&#8217;t work out for you, it&#8217;s your problem, not theirs, and you are
free: to fix it, to report the issue and hope someone will fix it, or to
look for a greener pasture. Your comments are valued if they help
developers make their program better for everybody, for example if it
helps fixing bugs that lots of people suffer from. Your opinions and
wishes may not be taken into account, however, unless you intend to
actually start working on them: patches are welcome, not additional work
(people are busy&nbsp;already).</p>
<p>We work to make Instantbird the best for you. We look forward to
gathering your feedback and acting upon it to make Instantbird even
better, for you. We assume that when someone takes the trouble to come
and talk with us to complain about something, there&#8217;s a valid concern.
Even when it&#8217;s well hidden behind factually inexact assertions that we
can&#8217;t agree with. If people cannot express themselves clearly, there&#8217;s a
reason why they are confused, and if a confusion is common, we should
find its cause and fix&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>As this difference may be a bit theoretical, I&#8217;m going to give a
concrete example in the next point: the way we deal with stability&nbsp;issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stability">
<h2>Stability</h2>
<div class="section" id="crash-reports">
<h3>Crash&nbsp;reports</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens in the unfortunate event of the user being hit by
a bug resulting in a crash of the&nbsp;application:</p>
<p>If you are using Pidgin and want to help get the bug fixed, you need to
<a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/GetABacktrace">get a backtrace</a> (on
Unix systems) or to have <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/TipsForBugReports#WhattodoifPidgincrashes">installed the debug symbols before the
crash</a>
so that a crash report could be dumped to the disk (on Windows). Then
you need to open a ticket on trac and give all the info you have. As
this process may be a bit scary for most end-users, I&#8217;m afraid valuable
feedback could get&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>If the same issue happens with Instantbird, first we&nbsp;apologize:</p>
<p><img alt="Instantbird crash reporter" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/crash-breakpad.png" /></p>
<p>Then all you have to do to send us the technical information about the
crash is a single click in this crash reporter dialog. We collect all
these crash reports and analyze them to improve the stability of the
next version of&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nightly-testing">
<h3>Nightly&nbsp;testing</h3>
<p>In addition to collecting crash reports, another thing we do to maintain
a high stability level for Instantbird is that we encourage early
adopters to run with nightly builds of Instantbird which are updated
almost daily with the very latest version of our source code. Therefore,
if something we changed degrades the stability, we receive crash reports
way before the defective change ends up in a release you may&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>If some change feels a bit risky to us, we push it to our testers at
least a week before releasing, or we delay it so that it gets
appropriate testing before being included in the next&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>Just as a comparison, Pidgin&#8217;s currently in development code is tested
only by developers and <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Installing%20Pidgin#WhydoyoualwayssaynottouseMTN">others people are discouraged from attempting to
use
it</a>.</p>
<p>Learn more about our <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2010/07/stability/">stability efforts</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changing">
<h2>Changing</h2>
<p>We keep seeing comments of people (who have not actually tried
Instantbird) who think we should go improve Pidgin instead of &#8220;wasting
time&#8221; on&nbsp;Instantbird.</p>
<p>In the page of our website where we explain <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.org/">why we create
Instantbird</a>, we&nbsp;conclude:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="compound">
<p>It&#8217;s time to bring back&nbsp;innovation!</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>To do this, we need to be able to change things easily. As Instantbird
is still a young project, we can change&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>Pidgin on the other hand is already a mature project with policies about
when it&#8217;s acceptable to change APIs or when they are frozen: it&#8217;s
basically impossible to change an <span class="caps">API</span> in Pidgin until a new major
version is released (so after the Pidgin 2.0.0 release, the <span class="caps">API</span> changes
have to wait until Pidgin 3.0.0 comes out to be included: currently
Pidgin 2.0.0 was released over four years ago!). This is a good thing to
ensure the plugins stay compatible, but it slows down the changes to the&nbsp;application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="different-feature-sets">
<h2>Different feature&nbsp;sets</h2>
<p>This is my last point even though most people would expect to see it
first. Instantbird and Pidgin have different feature&nbsp;sets.</p>
<p>On one hand, Pidgin has some features that Instantbird doesn&#8217;t have.
Some that we will have in the future. Some that we don&#8217;t want to have.
I&#8217;m not going to give a full list here because I don&#8217;t actually have a
list of all Pidgin features to compare and check what we have and what
we don&#8217;t have. We are neither trying to copy Pidgin nor to directly
compete against it, so such a list would be irrelevant&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Instantbird has some features that Pidgin doesn&#8217;t
have (message themes, automatic updates, inline search, &#8230;) and even
some unique features (for two examples, see my blog posts introducing
<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/06/introducing-time-bubbles/">Time Bubbles</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/06/introducing-magic-copy/">Magic copy</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, should you switch to Instantbird? If I were you, I would. But I&#8217;m
not you. Deciding which <span class="caps">IM</span> client you use is your choice, based on your
taste, your needs, your feelings. It&#8217;s your decision,&nbsp;really!</p>
<p>If you like what you currently have and see nothing you like in what
Instantbird offers, just keep using what you&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>If you love Instantbird, then, obviously you should use&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If you are in the middle and like Instantbird but for some reason can&#8217;t
use it because something you really need is missing or doesn&#8217;t work,
please tell us about it, we are eager to receive your feedback! And
maybe there&#8217;s already an add-on to customize Instantbird to do what you
wanted that we can point you&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>In any case, we are not going to try to force you to switch from Pidgin
or whatever <span class="caps">IM</span> client you may be using right now to Instantbird. We
respect your freedom, we respect your choices, we love&nbsp;you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <div class="section" id="servers-load">
<h2>Servers&nbsp;load</h2>
<p>Instantbird 1.0 has been very quickly downloaded over ten thousand of
times. In fact, it happened so fast (especially immediately after we
have been <a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/5816618/instantbird-is-a-lightweight-cross+platform-instant-messaging-app-with-sharp-looks">featured on
lifehacker</a>)
that our server couldn&#8217;t handle the&nbsp;load.</p>
<p>We have very quickly been able to mirror our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/">main
website</a> on another server, which
allowed people to keep discovering and downloading Instantbird 1.0, but
we had to close the add-ons website for a while as the load it couldn&#8217;t
handle was also putting down other services that we really needed to
keep online, especially our <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/">bug
database</a>.</p>
<p>We have tried to re-open the add-ons website at a quieter time, but the
server was unresponsive again within half an hour. This morning we tried
to improve the website&#8217;s performance by adding some caching mechanism
and reopened again (at a time when most Americans are asleep) for a try.
Again it fall&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Some people very kindly offered help and proposed to host the website on
their server, but it&#8217;s difficult to trust someone we barely know to host
a website that requires our <span class="caps">SSL</span>&nbsp;certificate.</p>
<p>As the add-ons website had been closed for almost 2 days already (sorry
for the inconvenience!) and extensibility is a key differentiator of
Instantbird compared to other similar <span class="caps">IM</span> clients, we decided that this
situation couldn&#8217;t last any longer and we solved the problem by throwing
money at it: we ordered a beefier server (Quad Core <span class="caps">CPU</span>, <span class="caps">16GB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span>)
and migrated the add-ons website to it as quickly as we could. The
website reopened this afternoon, and our testing confirmed that the new
server can easily handle the load, even with more visitors than we had
when the previous server stopped responding. It&#8217;s ready for a lot more
people coming! Don&#8217;t hesitate to tell your friends to try Instantbird
<img alt=":)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/sourire.png" />.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="feedback">
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>We have received a massive amount of feedback since the release. Most
was positive or extremely positive. We received lots of encouragements.
We even received some love&nbsp;letters!</p>
<p>Some of the feedback showed there was some confusion, for example about
how we are different from Pidgin (which we will be the subject of
another post to clarify things). We also received constructive
criticism, good bug reports. The most common request is an easy way to
retweet or to reply to a tweet. We will work on that soon <img alt=":)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/sourire.png" />. Tab
completion of nick names is also commonly requested, but even though
it&#8217;s clear we need to have this by default in the future, we can usually
satisfy the reporter by pointing to the great (restartless!) <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/276">Tab
Complete</a>&nbsp;add-on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updates">
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>As no alarming issue has been reported in Instantbird 1.0 which is
already widely used, we have decided to turn on major updates from
Instantbird 0.2 to Instantbird&nbsp;1.0.</p>
<p>Users of Instantbird 0.2 will be offered an update shortly with an
update prompt looking like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="Dialog offering a major update to Instantbird 1.0" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/major-update-1.0.png" /></p>
<p>Users of our 0.3pre nightly builds will be offered an update to a
nightly build numbered 1.1a1pre in the next few&nbsp;days.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, it&#8217;s been a great release and the last few days have been
exciting (even though they were also exhausting). We look forward to
continue hearing your feedback (and to actually act upon it!). Don&#8217;t
hesitate to share Instantbird with your friends. Our servers are&nbsp;ready!</p>

<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>We feel that a user should be able to make their instant messaging
client their own: we feel Instantbird can be customized best by giving
the user a <strong>simple and efficient</strong> user interface, and not attempting
to include hundreds of bundled options, but allowing the user to
<strong>customize</strong> via the powerful extensibility included in the Mozilla
platform. All elements of Instantbird are customizable, from the message
theme itself (we&#8217;ve built on the great message style format used in
Adium) to the Instantbird theme, user interface and protocols. There are
already over 250 add-ons available, here are some of our&nbsp;favorites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/248">Colorize</a>
&#8212; change a buddy&#8217;s color in a private conversation based on their&nbsp;name</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/250">Highlight</a>
&#8212; be notified of certain words in a chat as if they were your&nbsp;nickname</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/276">Tab
Complete</a>
&#8212; tab completion of nicknames and&nbsp;commands</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/249">Reply to
Nick</a>
&#8212; allows easy replying: double clicking a message in the chat
inserts the sender&#8217;s name in the message input&nbsp;box</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/251">Show

<h2>Respecting&nbsp;users</h2>
<p>As part of our belief in <strong>respecting our users</strong>, we give them an

<p>While Instantbird has received invaluable support from the Mozilla
community at large, it hasn&#8217;t been funded in any way by the Mozilla
Foundation. The company-quality infrastructure deployed to build and
support Instantbird has been funded by the initial creators who strongly
believe in the importance of this project. The increasingly fast growth
of Instantbird&#8217;s user base leads us to believe the project could find
some user-respecting revenue streams from which the project could become
economically sustainable and empower the non-profit created for it to
start hiring key contributors, following a model similar to what Mozilla
has been doing with&nbsp;Firefox.</p>

    <div class="section" id="the-current-system">
<h2>The current&nbsp;system</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the Instantbird project, we have released
versions numbered <tt class="docutils literal">0.x.y.z</tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">0.</tt> indicates that the initial goals of the project haven&#8217;t been
reached&nbsp;yet.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> is the major version number. For example, Instantbird 0.2 was a
major version for which we made very significant&nbsp;changes.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> is the minor version number, incremented when a release is very
similar to the previous one, but with some new features. We released
Instantbird 0.1.1, 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 which were minor new&nbsp;versions.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">z</tt> was used only for emergency bugfix releases. For example we
released 0.1.2.1 a day after 0.1.2 because of a very common crash on
Windows with some <span class="caps">MSN</span> accounts (not those we used during our testing
of course). We also released Instantbird 0.1.3.1 when Instantbird
0.1.3 was no longer able to connect to the <span class="caps">ICQ</span>&nbsp;network.</li>
</ul>
<p>This version numbering scheme made a lot of sense when the project was
initially a &#8220;<span class="caps">XUL</span> <span class="caps">UI</span> for Pidgin&#8221; and the goal was to reach &#8220;feature
parity&#8221; with Pidgin for Instantbird 1.0. We have, however, supported
features that Pidgin doesn&#8217;t have for a long time, thus defining the
completion of Instantbird 1.0 as a comparison with Pidgin doesn&#8217;t make
sense any more. Actually, our roadmap has stated for a long time already
that the 1.0 goal is a &#8220;Simple, usable and extensible user&nbsp;interface.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the 0.x.y.z version number, we are using &#8220;aN&#8221; and &#8220;bN&#8221;
suffixes for alpha and beta releases (0.3b1 for example), so the version
number in itself has nothing to do with stability (actually, our testers
report that even our nightly builds are stable!). 0.&lt;something&gt; only
means that we haven&#8217;t reached our initial goals, not that the version
isn&#8217;t&nbsp;stable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="received-feedback">
<h2>Received&nbsp;feedback</h2>
<p>While linux enthusiasts are used to have great software with a
not-yet-1.0 version number, on Windows a 0.* version number was a bit
misleading and we received mostly 2 kinds of feedback about the version&nbsp;number:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Wow, I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s so stable and featureful with such a low
version number!&#8221; (user who has downloaded and tested&nbsp;it)</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oh, it looks cool, but with such a low version number, it&#8217;s a
pre-alpha, it can&#8217;t be stable, I&#8217;ll give it a try when it reaches&nbsp;1.0.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Disappointing, isn&#8217;t it? <img alt=";-)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/clin_d'oeil.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next">
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>We are about to release Instantbird 0.3. This is a major version of
Instantbird, with more changes than any previous release. With the
current changes in the Mozilla release cycle, we are very unlikely to
ever release again a version containing so many changes at once (more
details on how we will adapt to release much more frequently in the
future in another post soon after the release). When releasing
Instantbird 0.2, we hesitated between incrementing the major version
number by only one (which is what we did), or skipping a few version
numbers to go straight to 0.5, because we felt we were half way through
on our goals of delivering a simple, easy to use, cross-platform,
multi-protocol, extensible instant messaging application. After the
fact, given the feedback related to the low version number that we
received, we regretted that we didn&#8217;t go ahead and release it as
Instantbird&nbsp;0.5.</p>
<p>What we called Instantbird 0.3 up to now is most likely the last major
release in which we change important things in every parts of the code
base at once. We don&#8217;t feel that we&#8217;re only &#8220;half way through&#8221;, so this
time we won&#8217;t have regrets: It&#8217;s going to be released as <strong>Instantbird
1.0</strong>.&nbsp;Tomorrow!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Another very visible change between Instantbird 0.2 and 0.3 is the
possibility to set a user icon and a display&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of the contact list with a place holder icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconPlaceholder.png" /></p>
<p>You will see a place holder icon at the top of the buddy list, just
click it (this will open a file picker) to set an icon. The icon will be
automatically resized and converted to fit the various size and format
requirements of the <span class="caps">IM</span> networks you&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Similarly, click the &#8220;Display name&#8221; place holder to edit it. This name
will be visible in your contacts&#8217; buddy lists (unfortunately this
currently works only for <span class="caps">MSN</span>).</p>
<p>Here you go, your friends will now easily recognize&nbsp;you:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of the contact list with an icon and a display name" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIcon.png" /></p>
<p>Conversation windows have also been changed to display your contacts&#8217;
icons and some more information (display name, status message,&nbsp;&#8230;):</p>
<p><img alt="conversation with an info bar showing the user icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconConvUI.png" /></p>
<p>I can already hear some comments about how much space this new
information bar takes (or wastes) in all conversation windows. Yes,
this takes a lot of space, we know. People tend to use big or very big
windows for chatting (sometimes even full screen!) but if you like the
ability to chat in small windows, don&#8217;t worry, we love you too! Just
resize the window and this information bar will shrink to ensure you
still see the actual content of the&nbsp;conversation:</p>
<p><img alt="conversation with a smaller info bar" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconSmallConvUI.png" /></p>
<p>And for very small conversation windows, the bar will completely
disappear, leaving only the strictly necessary user&nbsp;interface:</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The contact list was identified as a weak area of Instantbird 0.2. It
has been dramatically improved for Instantbird 0.3 which we plan to
release next&nbsp;week.</p>
<div class="section" id="tags">
<h2>Tags</h2>
<div class="section" id="goodbye-groups">
<h3>Goodbye&nbsp;groups</h3>
<p>Like most <span class="caps">IM</span> clients, Instantbird 0.2 had each contact placed in a
group, leading users to organize contacts a bit like files are placed in
folders on the&nbsp;disk.</p>
<p>While this seems ok at first, placing contacts inside groups doesn&#8217;t
work well when thinking of the contact as a person. Don&#8217;t you have a
friend (group &#8216;friend&#8217;) who is also a coworker (group&nbsp;&#8216;colleagues&#8217;)?</p>
<p>For this reason, with Instantbird 0.3 we replaced the notion of
&#8220;Groups&#8221; with the notion of &#8220;Tags&#8221; throughout the user interface.
While groups used to be containers for your contacts (it was possible
to move a contact from one group into another), tags are additional
data attached to the contact (you can add or remove tags on a contact,
but no longer &#8216;move&#8217; a contact) and thus a single contact can have
multiple tags. To change the tags attached to a contact, use the
&#8220;Tags&#8230;&#8221; context menu item of the contact; it shows a list of the
existing tags with a check mark next to the tags attached to the
selected contact. Checking/unchecking a tag in this list will
attach/detach a tag from the&nbsp;contact.</p>
<p><img alt="Tags menu" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/tags-menu.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hidden-tags">
<h3>Hidden&nbsp;tags</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty common when using several accounts of different protocols on
a multi-protocol client for the first time to have contacts scattered
around in lots of meaningless tags. These contacts are typically those
that have never been moved before and are still in whatever the default
group of the various previous clients&nbsp;were.</p>
<p>As moving each of these contacts out of these meaningless groups is
not really an interesting task, and sometimes is even impossible (if
the server doesn&#8217;t allow us to move it), we have designed a more
efficient way to forget the annoyance caused by the pointless
resulting tags: when hovering a tag in the contact list, you will see
an [x] icon. Clicking it will hide the tag (after showing an
explanation the first&nbsp;time).</p>
<p><img alt="Hide tag icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/hide-tag-button.png" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to manage the list of visible tags (to unhide a tag) from
the &#8220;Visible tags&#8230;&#8221; context menu&nbsp;item.</p>
<p>Contacts which haven&#8217;t been associated with a visible tag will be
displayed in a special &#8220;Other Contacts&#8221; tag, always at the bottom of the
contact&nbsp;list.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grouped-contacts">
<h2>Grouped&nbsp;contacts</h2>
<p>If several networks are usable to <span class="caps">IM</span> the same person, you will no longer
be annoyed by seeing that person listed several times in your contact
list. Just drag and drop one of these contacts onto another and
Instantbird will know they are both ways to contact the same&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>During future conversations, if your contact suddenly starts talking to
you from a different network, the conversation will continue in the same
tab. A system message will be displayed in the conversation to
unobtrusively notify you of this&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>If you want to start talking to a different account of your contact,
you can do so easily with a click on the protocol icon at the top
right of the conversation <span class="caps">UI</span>:</p>
<p><img alt="Talk using a different network" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/conversation-targets-menu.png" /></p>
<p>When starting a conversation from the contact list, Instantbird will
automatically select the best way to reach your contact, based on
availability information and your preference with regard to the
various ways to contact this person. You can change this preference by
expanding a contact (with the down arrow icon) and then using drag and
drop to reorder the&nbsp;accounts.</p>
<p><img alt="Expanded contact" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/expanded-contact.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-noticable-changes">
<h2>Other noticable&nbsp;changes</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The contact list is now sorted: both tags and contacts inside a tag
appear alphabetically&nbsp;sorted.</li>
<li>Changes in the displayed information are smoothly animated, making
them at the same time easier to understand and less&nbsp;interrupting.</li>
<li>Closing the contact list window, which is not needed all the time,
will no longer close Instantbird. On Windows and Linux it will be
minimized to the system tray (this behavior can be customized in the
Preference dialog); on Mac it can be easily reopened from the&nbsp;menubar.</li>

    <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2011/06/introducing-magic-copy/" rel="bookmark">Introducing magic&nbsp;copy</a></h1>
  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The surprise and enthusiasm of a few people about the &#8220;magic copy&#8221;
feature I mentioned briefly at the end of <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2011/06/introducing-time-bubbles/">my previous post</a>
introducing time bubbles reminded me that we forgot to introduce this
feature when it landed for Instantbird 0.2 as part of our implementation
of <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/2009/07/instantbird-0-2-feature-preview-conversations-customization/">the Adium message theme system</a>.</p>
<p>We decided to use this theme system because it seemed nice overall and
was already used by a few other clients as well. However there was
something we really didn&#8217;t like: using a customized message theme could
make copied data from the conversation really hard to read, to the point
that it would be unsuitable for sending a quote via&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>As this may not be very clear yet, let me give an&nbsp;example:</p>
<p><img alt="Copying from a conversation without the 'magic copy' feature" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-normal.png" /></p>
<p>This is the text we get when copying the selection to the clipboard and
pasting it. This is without our &#8220;magic copy&#8221; feature of&nbsp;course.</p>
<p>I should also note that the Bubbles theme used for this screenshot is
not the worst in this regards. I&#8217;ve seen in the description of some
themes (not designed for Instantbird) that they were &#8220;clipboard
friendly&#8221;, which indicates the theme author took this problem into
account and probably had to make some trade-offs between the visual
appearance and the usability of copied&nbsp;conversations.</p>
<p>As we were not satisfied with this situation (which either makes copying
from the conversation poorly usable or restricts theme authors&#8217;
creativity), we developed a different system that instead of serializing
the selected <span class="caps">HTML</span> attempts to detect which messages are selected, and to
&#8220;prettyprint&#8221; them based on what Instantbird knows about the message,
rather than what is visible and&nbsp;selected.</p>
<p>This is the&nbsp;result:</p>
<p><img alt="Same conversation copied with magic copy" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-magic.png" /></p>
<p>If only a part of a single message was selected, the username and
timestamp won&#8217;t be added to the copied strings, it will behave like a
normal text&nbsp;copy:</p>
<p><img alt="Copying a part of a single message" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-part-of-one-message.png" /></p>
<p>As we detect which messages are selected and even know if each message
was fully selected or only in part, we can nicely add an ellipsis when
a message was&nbsp;cut:</p>
<p><img alt="Ellipsis are added where messages are cut" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-ellipsis.png" /></p>
<p>This even works when using multiple-selections (press Ctrl on
Windows/Linux, and Command on Mac to do&nbsp;this):</p>
<p><img alt="Copying parts of multiple messages" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-multi-select.png" /></p>
<p>A few technical details: the template used to serialize copied messages
is both localizable and customizable from <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a>, it&#8217;s also
possible to completely turn off this feature in case it ever causes some
trouble (look for the <tt class="docutils literal">messenger.conversations.selections.*</tt> family of
preferences in <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a>).</p>
<p>This feature has been turned on by default in Instantbird for over a
year and nobody complained about it. Actually, it&#8217;s one of the features
that is barely noticed because it just works, but it is something that
is really missed if using another <span class="caps">IM</span> client after using Instantbird for
a&nbsp;while.</p>
