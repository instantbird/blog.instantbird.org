  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Instantbird team is pleased to announce a polished <strong>Instantbird
1.0</strong>, released today in 11&nbsp;locales.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/"><img alt="Instantbird logo" src="http://www.instantbird.com/press/logos/instantbird-text-512x128.png" /></a></p>
<p>Instantbird is an extremely easy to use and highly <strong>extensible instant
messaging</strong> client that aims to respect its&nbsp;users!</p>
<p>Building on the experience available via <strong>open-source</strong> software,
Instantbird is able to harness the power of Pidgin (via its libpurple
protocol library) and of Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox technology, to provide access
to a wide variety of instant messaging networks, while providing an easy
(and well known) extension platform. Although Instantbird is <strong>fully
cross-platform</strong> (Windows, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, Linux), we strive to present a
<strong>native look-and-feel</strong> to the user&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/">Get Instantbird 1.0&nbsp;now!</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/"><img alt="Instantbird 1.0 screenshot on Windows 7" src="http://www.instantbird.com/press/screenshots/1.0-winaero-screenshot-homepage-big.png" /></a></p>
<div class="section" id="supported-networks">
<h2>Supported&nbsp;networks</h2>
<p>First and foremost, Instantbird is an instant messaging client with a
wide variety of supported networks,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="caps">AOL</span> Instant Messenger (<span class="caps">AIM</span>)</li>
<li>Facebook&nbsp;Chat</li>
<li>Google&nbsp;Talk</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Windows Live Messenger (<span class="caps">MSN</span>&nbsp;Messenger)</li>
<li><span class="caps">XMPP</span>&nbsp;(Jabber)</li>
<li>Yahoo!&nbsp;Messenger</li>
</ul>
<p>But also many others like: Gadu-Gadu, Novell Groupwise, <span class="caps">ICQ</span>, <span class="caps">IRC</span>,
MySpaceIM, Netsoul, <span class="caps">QQ</span>, <span class="caps">SIMPLE</span>, Yahoo! <span class="caps">JAPAN</span>, and even more optionally
available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/">Instantbird Add-Ons
website</a>, such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/269">Omegle</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/255"><span class="caps">LJ</span> Talk
(LiveJournal)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extensibility">
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>We feel that a user should be able to make their instant messaging
client their own: we feel Instantbird can be customized best by giving
the user a <strong>simple and efficient</strong> user interface, and not attempting
to include hundreds of bundled options, but allowing the user to
<strong>customize</strong> via the powerful extensibility included in the Mozilla
platform. All elements of Instantbird are customizable, from the message
theme itself (we&#8217;ve built on the great message style format used in
Adium) to the Instantbird theme, user interface and protocols. There are
already over 250 add-ons available, here are some of our&nbsp;favorites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/248">Colorize</a>
&#8212; change a buddy&#8217;s color in a private conversation based on their&nbsp;name</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/250">Highlight</a>
&#8212; be notified of certain words in a chat as if they were your&nbsp;nickname</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/276">Tab
Complete</a>
&#8212; tab completion of nicknames and&nbsp;commands</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/249">Reply to
Nick</a>
&#8212; allows easy replying: double clicking a message in the chat
inserts the sender&#8217;s name in the message input&nbsp;box</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/251">Show
Nick</a>
&#8212; colors the nicknames in messages in multi-user&nbsp;chats</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/244">Vertical
Tabs</a>
&#8212; too many conversations open? Move the tabs from horizontal to&nbsp;vertical!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="respecting-users">
<h2>Respecting&nbsp;users</h2>
<p>As part of our belief in <strong>respecting our users</strong>, we give them an
<strong>ad-free experience</strong> and respect their privacy by not collecting any
information about them (Instantbird contacts our servers only when
checking for updates, or in the unfortunate and uncommon event of a&nbsp;crash).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-us">
<h2>About&nbsp;us</h2>
<p>The Instantbird team is a group of volunteers who are passionate about
empowering instant messaging users by providing a stable, fun instant
messenger. Read more about <a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/about.html">who we
are</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.org/">our core beliefs and
values</a>.</p>
<p>While Instantbird has received invaluable support from the Mozilla
community at large, it hasn&#8217;t been funded in any way by the Mozilla
Foundation. The company-quality infrastructure deployed to build and
support Instantbird has been funded by the initial creators who strongly
believe in the importance of this project. The increasingly fast growth
of Instantbird&#8217;s user base leads us to believe the project could find
some user-respecting revenue streams from which the project could become
economically sustainable and empower the non-profit created for it to
start hiring key contributors, following a model similar to what Mozilla
has been doing with&nbsp;Firefox.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank all of our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instantbird.com/thanks.html">contributors and
translators</a> who have helped
build Instantbird. In addition, we&#8217;d also like to thank our invaluable
beta and nightly testers who provide timely bug reports and help track
down&nbsp;regressions!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <div class="section" id="the-current-system">
<h2>The current&nbsp;system</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the Instantbird project, we have released
versions numbered <tt class="docutils literal">0.x.y.z</tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">0.</tt> indicates that the initial goals of the project haven&#8217;t been
reached&nbsp;yet.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> is the major version number. For example, Instantbird 0.2 was a
major version for which we made very significant&nbsp;changes.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> is the minor version number, incremented when a release is very
similar to the previous one, but with some new features. We released
Instantbird 0.1.1, 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 which were minor new&nbsp;versions.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">z</tt> was used only for emergency bugfix releases. For example we
released 0.1.2.1 a day after 0.1.2 because of a very common crash on
Windows with some <span class="caps">MSN</span> accounts (not those we used during our testing
of course). We also released Instantbird 0.1.3.1 when Instantbird
0.1.3 was no longer able to connect to the <span class="caps">ICQ</span>&nbsp;network.</li>
</ul>
<p>This version numbering scheme made a lot of sense when the project was
initially a &#8220;<span class="caps">XUL</span> <span class="caps">UI</span> for Pidgin&#8221; and the goal was to reach &#8220;feature
parity&#8221; with Pidgin for Instantbird 1.0. We have, however, supported
features that Pidgin doesn&#8217;t have for a long time, thus defining the
completion of Instantbird 1.0 as a comparison with Pidgin doesn&#8217;t make
sense any more. Actually, our roadmap has stated for a long time already
that the 1.0 goal is a &#8220;Simple, usable and extensible user&nbsp;interface.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the 0.x.y.z version number, we are using &#8220;aN&#8221; and &#8220;bN&#8221;
suffixes for alpha and beta releases (0.3b1 for example), so the version
number in itself has nothing to do with stability (actually, our testers
report that even our nightly builds are stable!). 0.&lt;something&gt; only
means that we haven&#8217;t reached our initial goals, not that the version
isn&#8217;t&nbsp;stable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="received-feedback">
<h2>Received&nbsp;feedback</h2>
<p>While linux enthusiasts are used to have great software with a
not-yet-1.0 version number, on Windows a 0.* version number was a bit
misleading and we received mostly 2 kinds of feedback about the version&nbsp;number:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Wow, I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s so stable and featureful with such a low
version number!&#8221; (user who has downloaded and tested&nbsp;it)</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oh, it looks cool, but with such a low version number, it&#8217;s a
pre-alpha, it can&#8217;t be stable, I&#8217;ll give it a try when it reaches&nbsp;1.0.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Disappointing, isn&#8217;t it? <img alt=";-)" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/smileys/clin_d'oeil.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next">
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>We are about to release Instantbird 0.3. This is a major version of
Instantbird, with more changes than any previous release. With the
current changes in the Mozilla release cycle, we are very unlikely to
ever release again a version containing so many changes at once (more
details on how we will adapt to release much more frequently in the
future in another post soon after the release). When releasing
Instantbird 0.2, we hesitated between incrementing the major version
number by only one (which is what we did), or skipping a few version
numbers to go straight to 0.5, because we felt we were half way through
on our goals of delivering a simple, easy to use, cross-platform,
multi-protocol, extensible instant messaging application. After the
fact, given the feedback related to the low version number that we
received, we regretted that we didn&#8217;t go ahead and release it as
Instantbird&nbsp;0.5.</p>
<p>What we called Instantbird 0.3 up to now is most likely the last major
release in which we change important things in every parts of the code
base at once. We don&#8217;t feel that we&#8217;re only &#8220;half way through&#8221;, so this
time we won&#8217;t have regrets: It&#8217;s going to be released as <strong>Instantbird
1.0</strong>.&nbsp;Tomorrow!</p>

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Another very visible change between Instantbird 0.2 and 0.3 is the
possibility to set a user icon and a display&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of the contact list with a place holder icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconPlaceholder.png" /></p>
<p>You will see a place holder icon at the top of the buddy list, just
click it (this will open a file picker) to set an icon. The icon will be
automatically resized and converted to fit the various size and format
requirements of the <span class="caps">IM</span> networks you&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Similarly, click the &#8220;Display name&#8221; place holder to edit it. This name
will be visible in your contacts&#8217; buddy lists (unfortunately this
currently works only for <span class="caps">MSN</span>).</p>
<p>Here you go, your friends will now easily recognize&nbsp;you:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of the contact list with an icon and a display name" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIcon.png" /></p>
<p>Conversation windows have also been changed to display your contacts&#8217;
icons and some more information (display name, status message,&nbsp;&#8230;):</p>
<p><img alt="conversation with an info bar showing the user icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconConvUI.png" /></p>
<p>I can already hear some comments about how much space this new
information bar takes (or wastes) in all conversation windows. Yes,
this takes a lot of space, we know. People tend to use big or very big
windows for chatting (sometimes even full screen!) but if you like the
ability to chat in small windows, don&#8217;t worry, we love you too! Just
resize the window and this information bar will shrink to ensure you
still see the actual content of the&nbsp;conversation:</p>
<p><img alt="conversation with a smaller info bar" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconSmallConvUI.png" /></p>
<p>And for very small conversation windows, the bar will completely
disappear, leaving only the strictly necessary user&nbsp;interface:</p>
<p><img alt="small conversation without the info bar" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/userIconNoConvUI.png" /></p>

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The contact list was identified as a weak area of Instantbird 0.2. It
has been dramatically improved for Instantbird 0.3 which we plan to
release next&nbsp;week.</p>
<div class="section" id="tags">
<h2>Tags</h2>
<div class="section" id="goodbye-groups">
<h3>Goodbye&nbsp;groups</h3>
<p>Like most <span class="caps">IM</span> clients, Instantbird 0.2 had each contact placed in a
group, leading users to organize contacts a bit like files are placed in
folders on the&nbsp;disk.</p>
<p>While this seems ok at first, placing contacts inside groups doesn&#8217;t
work well when thinking of the contact as a person. Don&#8217;t you have a
friend (group &#8216;friend&#8217;) who is also a coworker (group&nbsp;&#8216;colleagues&#8217;)?</p>
<p>For this reason, with Instantbird 0.3 we replaced the notion of
&#8220;Groups&#8221; with the notion of &#8220;Tags&#8221; throughout the user interface.
While groups used to be containers for your contacts (it was possible
to move a contact from one group into another), tags are additional
data attached to the contact (you can add or remove tags on a contact,
but no longer &#8216;move&#8217; a contact) and thus a single contact can have
multiple tags. To change the tags attached to a contact, use the
&#8220;Tags&#8230;&#8221; context menu item of the contact; it shows a list of the
existing tags with a check mark next to the tags attached to the
selected contact. Checking/unchecking a tag in this list will
attach/detach a tag from the&nbsp;contact.</p>
<p><img alt="Tags menu" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/tags-menu.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hidden-tags">
<h3>Hidden&nbsp;tags</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty common when using several accounts of different protocols on
a multi-protocol client for the first time to have contacts scattered
around in lots of meaningless tags. These contacts are typically those
that have never been moved before and are still in whatever the default
group of the various previous clients&nbsp;were.</p>
<p>As moving each of these contacts out of these meaningless groups is
not really an interesting task, and sometimes is even impossible (if
the server doesn&#8217;t allow us to move it), we have designed a more
efficient way to forget the annoyance caused by the pointless
resulting tags: when hovering a tag in the contact list, you will see
an [x] icon. Clicking it will hide the tag (after showing an
explanation the first&nbsp;time).</p>
<p><img alt="Hide tag icon" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/hide-tag-button.png" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to manage the list of visible tags (to unhide a tag) from
the &#8220;Visible tags&#8230;&#8221; context menu&nbsp;item.</p>
<p>Contacts which haven&#8217;t been associated with a visible tag will be
displayed in a special &#8220;Other Contacts&#8221; tag, always at the bottom of the
contact&nbsp;list.</p>

<h2>Grouped&nbsp;contacts</h2>
<p>If several networks are usable to <span class="caps">IM</span> the same person, you will no longer
be annoyed by seeing that person listed several times in your contact

Instantbird will know they are both ways to contact the same&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>During future conversations, if your contact suddenly starts talking to
you from a different network, the conversation will continue in the same
tab. A system message will be displayed in the conversation to
unobtrusively notify you of this&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>If you want to start talking to a different account of your contact,
you can do so easily with a click on the protocol icon at the top

<p><img alt="Talk using a different network" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/conversation-targets-menu.png" /></p>
<p>When starting a conversation from the contact list, Instantbird will
automatically select the best way to reach your contact, based on
availability information and your preference with regard to the
various ways to contact this person. You can change this preference by
expanding a contact (with the down arrow icon) and then using drag and
drop to reorder the&nbsp;accounts.</p>

<li>Closing the contact list window, which is not needed all the time,
will no longer close Instantbird. On Windows and Linux it will be

  </header><!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The surprise and enthusiasm of a few people about the &#8220;magic copy&#8221;
feature I mentioned briefly at the end of <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/articles/introducing-time-bubbles.rst">my previous post</a>
introducing time bubbles reminded me that we forgot to introduce this
feature when it landed for Instantbird 0.2 as part of our implementation
of <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/articles/instantbird-0-2-feature-preview-conversations-customization.rst">the Adium message theme system</a>.</p>
<p>We decided to use this theme system because it seemed nice overall and
was already used by a few other clients as well. However there was
something we really didn&#8217;t like: using a customized message theme could
make copied data from the conversation really hard to read, to the point
that it would be unsuitable for sending a quote via&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>As this may not be very clear yet, let me give an&nbsp;example:</p>
<p><img alt="Copying from a conversation without the 'magic copy' feature" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-normal.png" /></p>
<p>This is the text we get when copying the selection to the clipboard and
pasting it. This is without our &#8220;magic copy&#8221; feature of&nbsp;course.</p>
<p>I should also note that the Bubbles theme used for this screenshot is
not the worst in this regards. I&#8217;ve seen in the description of some
themes (not designed for Instantbird) that they were &#8220;clipboard
friendly&#8221;, which indicates the theme author took this problem into
account and probably had to make some trade-offs between the visual
appearance and the usability of copied&nbsp;conversations.</p>
<p>As we were not satisfied with this situation (which either makes copying
from the conversation poorly usable or restricts theme authors&#8217;
creativity), we developed a different system that instead of serializing
the selected <span class="caps">HTML</span> attempts to detect which messages are selected, and to
&#8220;prettyprint&#8221; them based on what Instantbird knows about the message,
rather than what is visible and&nbsp;selected.</p>
<p>This is the&nbsp;result:</p>
<p><img alt="Same conversation copied with magic copy" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-magic.png" /></p>
<p>If only a part of a single message was selected, the username and
timestamp won&#8217;t be added to the copied strings, it will behave like a
normal text&nbsp;copy:</p>
<p><img alt="Copying a part of a single message" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-part-of-one-message.png" /></p>
<p>As we detect which messages are selected and even know if each message
was fully selected or only in part, we can nicely add an ellipsis when
a message was&nbsp;cut:</p>
<p><img alt="Ellipsis are added where messages are cut" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-ellipsis.png" /></p>
<p>This even works when using multiple-selections (press Ctrl on
Windows/Linux, and Command on Mac to do&nbsp;this):</p>
<p><img alt="Copying parts of multiple messages" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/copy-multi-select.png" /></p>
<p>A few technical details: the template used to serialize copied messages
is both localizable and customizable from <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a>, it&#8217;s also
possible to completely turn off this feature in case it ever causes some
trouble (look for the <tt class="docutils literal">messenger.conversations.selections.*</tt> family of
preferences in <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a>).</p>
<p>This feature has been turned on by default in Instantbird for over a
year and nobody complained about it. Actually, it&#8217;s one of the features
that is barely noticed because it just works, but it is something that
is really missed if using another <span class="caps">IM</span> client after using Instantbird for
a&nbsp;while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Instantbird 0.2 was released with Bubbles as its default message&nbsp;theme:</p>
<p><img alt="default message themes of Instantbird 0.2" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/instantbird-0.2-default-themes.png" /></p>
<p>The most common feedback we received from users that quickly switched
back to Simple (the previous default) or another theme was that the lack
of timestamp for each message made the theme&nbsp;unusable.</p>
<p>Some users have really passionate opinions about whether these
timestamps should be shown or not. On one hand, people think it&#8217;s a
useful piece of information that should always be visible, but on the
other hand, people think it&#8217;s a waste of space on their limited screens.
The common &#8220;solution&#8221; to this problem is to include a &#8220;show timestamp&#8221;
preference, allowing each user to decide for themselves which of the two
behaviors is the least&nbsp;inconvenient.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that making the user responsible for choosing between two
not-so-good options which one is best is a good way to address this
issue. So soon after the 0.2 release, I started searching for better&nbsp;solutions.</p>
<p>I tried to identify what the information provided by message timestamps
was used for, so that we could hopefully find something appropriate for
the actual&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>The starting points of my reflection were&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>timestamps, when visible, are most of the time&nbsp;ignored.</li>
<li>when they are actually read, the information they provide is rarely
the information really desired, but only an indirect way to answer a
valid&nbsp;question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So then, I tried to identify which questions users who wanted to have
their timestamps visible all the time had to answer. Here are the
questions I found, and what I&#8217;ve implemented to provide human friendly
answers to these&nbsp;questions:</p>
<div class="section" id="how-much-time-has-passed-between-2-messages">
<h2>1. How much time has passed between 2&nbsp;messages?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s actually still an indirect answer to another question: has that
person talking to me actually read what I said and thought about it
before replying? Sometimes when receiving an answer that doesn&#8217;t seem to
take into account what has just been said, it&#8217;s just that the message
wasn&#8217;t read yet at the time the reply was&nbsp;written.</p>
<p>I believe having to read and compare mentally 2 timestamps to get that
information is overly complicated and we can convey this information&nbsp;visually:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot with 2 bubbles touching each other, and 2 bubbles with some space between them" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/bubbles-with-different-spacing.png" /></p>
<p>The vertical space between Bubbles is used to show how much time
separates messages. If 2 people talked at the same second, their bubbles
will almost touch each other. If there&#8217;s been a pause between the
messages, there will be some space between the&nbsp;bubbles.</p>
<p>In order to not waste too much space when 2 messages are separated by a
long time, I decided that the first few seconds would cause a much
bigger increase of the space than the next seconds and minutes (for the
readers who care about the details: it&#8217;s a logarithmic representation of
the&nbsp;time).</p>
<p>This makes it easy to see a difference in time just after a message was
received (the very few seconds that make the difference between a
likely-read message and a most-likely-not-read-yet message), but makes
it hard to evaluate time intervals of several minutes. To address that,
when messages are separated by over 5 minutes, the exact time is
displayed between the bubbles in gray&nbsp;text:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of 2 messages with over 5 minutes of interval" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/bubbles-with-over-5-minutes-between-them.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-this-message-old">
<h2>2. Is this message&nbsp;old?</h2>
<p>This question is especially interesting when returning to the computer
after being away, and having several conversations with new messages, to
decide which one to answer to first. If a message has already been
waiting there for an hour or so, the person has probably moved on
already, and is most likely not actively waiting for your answer.
However, if a message was sent only a few seconds or minutes ago, it&#8217;s
reasonable to expect that the person is still at the other end and still
remembers what was&nbsp;discussed.</p>
<p>To answer this question, my proposition is to make the space between the
latest message and the text input box vary exactly like the space
between 2 bubbles. Unlike the time between 2 bubbles which doesn&#8217;t
change, the time between the last message and now changes continuously,
so displaying this time requires an animation: messages will &#8220;scroll
away&#8221; as they get old. If a message is older than 5 minutes, the time
since it appeared will be written (omitting seconds, so that the text
displayed doesn&#8217;t change&nbsp;continuously).</p>
<p>Just arrived message: <img alt="screenshot of the area at the bottom of the conversation without space" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/bubble-just-arrived-message.png" /></p>
<p>Message arrived a while ago: <img alt="screenshot of the area at the bottom of the conversation with a lot of space and the time displayed" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/bubble-message-arrived-minutes-ago.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-did-i-say-that">
<h2>3. When did I say&nbsp;that?</h2>
<p>This question occurs occasionally when looking for something in the
backlog (typically using <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/articles/conversation-tools.rst">the findbar</a>).
In this case, the time is actually the desired information, but seconds
are irrelevant, so only the hour and minutes need to be displayed. For
this case, I decided to display the time of the first message of a
bubble when the bubbles is&nbsp;hovered:</p>
<p><img alt="hovered bubble" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/bubble-hovered.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-was-the-time-of-a-specific-message">
<h2>4. What was the time of a specific&nbsp;message?</h2>
<p>This rather rare question was already addressed with a little known
feature of the existing bubble theme: when hovering a message, a tooltip
appears showing a timestamp for that specific&nbsp;message.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-quoting-messages-to-paste-in-emails-for-example-i-need-the-messages-to-have-some-time-information-associated-with-them-in-plain-text">
<h2>5. When quoting messages (to paste in emails for example), I need the messages to have some time information associated with them in plain&nbsp;text!</h2>
<p>While this is a valid concern, it&#8217;s out of the scope of the message
theme design, as Instantbird 0.2 already supported a nice feature that
we called &#8220;magic copy&#8221;: when a selection inside a conversation is copied
into the clipboard, Instantbird will detect which messages are selected,
and &#8220;prettyprint&#8221; them so that whatever message theme is currently in
used doesn&#8217;t change the appearance of quoted&nbsp;messages.</p>
<p><img alt="the input box with a copy of some selected messages" src="https://blog.instantbird.org/images/bubbles-magic-copy.png" /></p>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have experimented with all of these suggestions for over a year
already with a modified version of the Bubble theme, called &#8220;Time
Bubbles&#8221; which was in an add-on. As the results of the experiment were
satisfying, the &#8220;Time Bubbles&#8221; feature is now part of the Bubbles theme
which is used by default in Instantbird. You can try it in <a class="reference external" href="http://nightly.instantbird.im/">current
nightly builds</a>, and it will be in
Instantbird 0.3 beta 1 which we plan to release very soon. We look
forward to your feedback on&nbsp;this!</p>
