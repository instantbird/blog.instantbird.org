      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Following the release of Instantbird 1.0, we&#8217;ve received a variety of
great feedback (if you haven&#8217;t read some of our other posts: we love to
receive feedback, although we might not always agree) via our <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/instantbird-contact/topics">contact
email
address</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/instantbird">our <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel</a>, our <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/">bug
tracker</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/instantbird">Twitter</a> and what ever other ways
there are to communicate with us. We&#8217;d like to take some time to respond
to some of the popular requests we&#8217;ve got (or at the very least, point
you to the bug where you can follow any&nbsp;progress).</p>
<p><strong>File transfer support</strong>: something we definitely want, but we also
want to give a good user experience. Unfortunately most protocols do not
transfer files efficiently or quickly (and many times they break when
behind firewalls, etc.), thus we wish to offer an alternative to using
the protocol file transfer before providing support for it: see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9">bug
9</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Grouping buddies first by protocol then by group</strong>: this has been
requested by multiple individuals, but we don&#8217;t feel it would fit well
into Instantbird. Instantbird is a multi-protocol instant messaging
client that aims to integrate all of your accounts together (therefore
it doesn&#8217;t make sense to separate your accounts on the contact&nbsp;list).</p>
<p>For example, is your &#8220;Friend&#8221; not your friend whether it&#8217;s your <span class="caps">MSN</span>
account, your <span class="caps">AIM</span> account or your Facebook account? Of course they still
are! But perhaps you have different groups of friends on <span class="caps">MSN</span> than on <span class="caps">AIM</span>
(maybe one is your online gaming buddies and one is your high school
friends); well our suggestion is to move them to tags that make more
sense (i.e. make an &#8220;Online Gaming Buddies&#8221; tag for all your <span class="caps">MSN</span> friends
and a &#8220;School Friends&#8221; tag for all your <span class="caps">AIM</span> friends, in this&nbsp;example).</p>
<p>When asking people why they want this, the response usually is &#8220;that&#8217;s
what &lt;another <span class="caps">IM</span> client&gt; does&#8221;. Well, ok but we wish that you take more
of a &#8216;contact level view&#8217; of people: <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.instantbird.org/articles/better-contact-list.rst">Combine your contacts that are the
same person</a> and
group them according to how you know them. (You can even put them in
multiple tags, if someone is your online gaming buddy <span class="caps">AND</span> from&nbsp;school!)</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a usecase that we&#8217;re not covering here, please let us know!
(And don&#8217;t forget that Instantbird is fully extensible, so you could
certainly write an extension to display the contacts grouped first by
protocol if you really need that&nbsp;feature.)</p>
<p><strong>Blocking buddies at the protocol level</strong>: unfortunately support for
this isn&#8217;t great depending on the protocol, but libpurple does support
it. We have two bugs on file; one is to <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135">block individual
users</a> and
another to <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704">block all buddies not on your buddy
list</a>, which
might not be supported by all&nbsp;protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Blocking spam</strong>: although this is similar to blocking buddies, it&#8217;s
different in that you do not wish to block <span class="caps">ALL</span> people not on your buddy
list, but of course you still want to ignore the obvious spam messages!
See <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288">bug 288</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=887">bug 887</a>
for two ideas on how to implement&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>Start with the operating system</strong>: many people expect an <span class="caps">IM</span> client to
start with their operating system and although most operating systems
provide a way to manually make a program start on boot, it would be
convenient for Instantbird to provide an option to do this. This was
requested in <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376">bug
376</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook &#8220;Not Authorized&#8221; error</strong>: we added the solution to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://instantbird.com/faq.html#facebookauthorization"><span class="caps">FAQ</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Voice/video</strong>: we&#8217;d love to support voice/video too! But libpurple
does not yet support voice/video on Windows or Mac, you can see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=568">bug
568</a> for some
information on how we could support it in JavaScript&nbsp;protocols.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">OTR</span> (off the record messaging)</strong>: private messaging is something we
believe is useful, but it needs to be convenient and transparent to the
users (after authentication, of course!). Encrypted chat is not a
trivial task, especially when the protocols don&#8217;t support it, but
there&#8217;s a library (called Off the Record) which handles this for us, we
have a bug about integrating it: <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=877">bug
877</a>.</p>
<p><strong>People want 64-bit Linux versions</strong>: we actually currently <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.instantbird.org/instantbird/releases/1.0/contrib/">supply
unsupported 64-bit
builds</a>,
and there&#8217;s a bug about making them official (<a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395">bug
395</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Instantbird interrupts you</strong>: if you receive a new <span class="caps">IM</span> window
Instantbird rudely pops to the front, this is mostly noticeable when
using another application as a fullscreen window (<a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=926">bug
926</a>). Luckily
for now, there&#8217;s currently an easy workaround: keep a conversation
window opened and minimized, so that a new conversation appears in a tab
of the existing window instead of a new&nbsp;window.</p>
<p><strong>Being able to search/filter the contacts</strong> would be helpful: we agree!
In fact we filed a bug about it: <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631">bug
631</a>.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>System tray issues</strong>:</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Persist the tray icon</strong>: the system tray icon should stay visible
even when the buddy list is restored, see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749">bug
749</a>.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Single click to restore the tray icon</strong>: <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/291/">an
extension</a>
was created to support this and by default the next version of
Instantbird will use single click on Linux and double click on Windows
(see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870">bug
870</a>).</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Expand the system tray context menu to change the status</strong>: this
would be helpful and would match what was added to the jumplists for
Windows 7, see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=750">bug
750</a> about
any work on this.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We&#8217;ve heard that <strong>some protocols are having problems</strong>:</div>
<div class="line"><strong><span class="caps">QQ</span> does not work</strong>: we&#8217;ve had reports of <span class="caps">QQ</span> not connecting (<span class="caps">QQ</span> was
actually dropped from Pidgin and spun off into a separate project
(<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/libqq-pidgin/">libqq</a>), which we <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021">intend
to include</a>.</div>
<div class="line"><strong><span class="caps">ICQ</span> does not connect with default settings</strong>: we have begun to
investigate this in <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=894">bug
894</a>, but it
seems that <span class="caps">SSL</span> is broken for now.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Twitter has a variety of issues</strong> and needs more work, including:
retweeting and replying to messages, direct messaging and showing a
list of who you follow and who follows you.</div>
<div class="line">A few suggestions to <strong>replace the libpurple <span class="caps">MSN</span> with msn-pecan</strong>: we
actually have still not updated to the newest <span class="caps">MSN</span> code from libpurple
2.9.0 (as it was causing crashes for one of our developers), see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=907">bug
907</a> for the
details.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">People want <strong>more protocols</strong>:</div>
<div class="line"><strong><span class="caps">IBM</span> Lotus Sametime</strong>: we&#8217;ve actually <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102">added
support</a> for
this in the nightly builds and it&#8217;ll be included in the next version!</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Bonjour</strong>: this should be fairly easy to add on Mac, but Windows and
Linux would require an extra library from Apple to support Bonjour. If
you&#8217;re interested in adding it, see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=944">bug
944</a>.</div>
<div class="line"><strong><span class="caps">SIPE</span> (Microsoft Office Communicator)</strong>: one of our developers has
started working on this in <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=976">bug
976</a>.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Skype</strong>: supporting Skype is non-trivial and requires Skype to be
running in the background, use of (the non-free) SkypeKit or reverse
engineering the protocol, see <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563">bug
563</a> for some
ideas.</div>
</div>
<p>Lots of positive feedback! Including that Instantbird works great with
screen readers! We&#8217;ve received <span class="caps">TONS</span> of other great feedback as well,
this is just a summary of the popular feedback we&#8217;ve&nbsp;received.</p>
<p>Please remember that one of the team&#8217;s goals is to keep Instantbird as
light as possible, and for that reason, we are trying to encourage the
idea of creating add-ons for things that may not seem as a core
necessity for the larger&nbsp;audience.</p>
<p>Development of Instantbird 1.1 is already well underway. We have a
tentative
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Roadmap:1.1">roadmap</a> for
it. We definitely plan to release faster than we used to do before
Instantbird 1.0. Our current target date for the next release is the end
of&nbsp;September!</p>

    <div class="comment-content"><p>Well Instant Bird is my preferred im-client at the&nbsp;moment.</p>
<p>It is light non intrusive and works&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>I would recommend you to add some social networking option in it that I can use to share when I&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>Problem I am facing with it&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>1. I got a huge friend list and when I enable buddy notification add on, the notifications just&nbsp;hang.</p>
<p>2. Instantbird hangs often handling my huge list and I have to restart it&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>3. To use additional feature like video or voice chat I still have to switch back to original client and I would love to see them here soon. I have seen many other other multi im messenger using&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>And at last just a suggestion. Though it is not-for-profit I would suggest you to add non intrusive ads like yahoo messenger and I hope your user will understand that. While it will be a revenue source for&nbsp;you.</p>
