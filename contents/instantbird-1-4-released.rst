Instantbird 1.4, hot off the presses! We've made a lot of improvements
(for full details, see the `release
notes <http://www.instantbird.com/release-notes.html>`__):

**Twitter:**

-  The character counter should now be correct when tweeting links.
-  Twitter now uses the v1.1 API, this will allow Twitter to continue
   working past June 11th, 2013 (when the v1.0 API is disabled).

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Invalid/self-signed/out-of-date SSL certificates can now be easily
overridden for IRC accounts.

   </li>
   <li>

Logs are now organized by the date they were created, and smartly folded
to easily find recent chats.

   </ul>

As we stated during the `Instantbird 1.3
release <http://blog.instantbird.org/2012/11/instantbird-1-3-released/>`__,
this version now requires Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Instantbird 1.4
is based off Mozilla 20 and libpurple 2.10.7, the newest versions
available.

You might be asking "What's next?" for Instantbird; we will be
participating in `Google Summer of Code
2013 <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode13#Instantbird>`__
(again through Mozilla). Through this and our other volunteers, we'll
continue improving Instantbird to make it a chat program you love to
use. Hopefully we can integrate some cool new features from this year's
Google Summer of Code and finish integrating the Account Import Wizard
from Google Summer of Code 2012! As always, if you see any issues,
please `file bugs <https://bugzilla.instantbird.org>`__!
