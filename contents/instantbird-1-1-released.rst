Exactly 4 years after the very early 0.1 preview, Instantbird 1.1 has
just been released today in 13 locales (Swedish and Estonian are new)!

In addition to several stability fixes and a dramatic reduction of
resource consumption in some cases, this new release will make Twitter
and IRC much more usable in Instantbird:

-  On Twitter, it's now possible from the context menu to **retweet**,
   to **reply to a tweet** (or simply double click on the tweet to start
   a reply). The context menu also lets you follow or unfollow the
   author of the tweet.
-  **Tab completion** of usernames (starting with an @ character on
   twitter) or nicknames (in IRC channels) will also be very
   appreciated.

All these changes have been commonly requested, so no surprise here. But
there's one last feature I would like to talk about before offering you
a download link: Instantbird 1.1 brings support for putting conversation
on hold. This means you can now **close conversation tabs without
leaving the conversation**, the conversation will sit at the top of the
Contacts window until you reopen it or someone talks to you. While this
may seem like a small change, it's exceptionally useful for IRC users
who tend to idle in lots of channels because they want to "be there just
in case" but don't interact much with the conversation.

Enough talk! Time to go `download Instantbird
