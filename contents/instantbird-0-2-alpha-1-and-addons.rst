Today is a very special day for us. We have a double release to
announce!

First, the long awaited add-ons website is now ready for you to use. You
will already find a lot of extensions on it since we took care of
uploading more than 200 of them. Think about browsing the experimental
add-ons, a lot of them are still marked as such. The add-ons website is
at this address: https://addons.instantbird.org/.

And last, but not least, `Instantbird 0.2 alpha
1 <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.2a1.html>`__ is now ready for
you to try it! There's a lot of new interesting stuff in this one. Here
are some of them, read the `release
notes <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.2a1.html>`__ for more:

-  It is `ready to be
   localized <http://blog.instantbird.org/a10-instantbird-0-2-feature-preview-localizability.html>`__
   (and you can try an `experimental French language
   pack <https://addons.instantbird.org/en-US/instantbird/addon/207>`__),
-  `Improved
   conversations <http://blog.instantbird.org/a11-instantbird-0-2-feature-preview-conversations-customization.html>`__:
   you can change conversation styles, smiley themes are now handled.
-  We implemented a 'magic' copy/paste feature that will allow you to
   have pretty quotes out of messages copied from Instantbird. Some bugs
   may still exist in this.
-  As usual, we took great care of stability issues, so Instantbird 0.2
   alpha 1 is already more stable than 0.1.3.1 at this point, so don't
   hesitate to give it a try!

You can download the alpha and read the release notes from
`here <http://www.instantbird.com/download-0.2a1.html>`__.
