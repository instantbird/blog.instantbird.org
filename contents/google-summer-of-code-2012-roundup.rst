Instantbird 1.2 was released about two months ago and we must again
apologize for keeping this blog fairly quiet.  Sorry about that!  But
we're here now, so read on for some (not really so) juicy Instantbird
news!

Instantbird 1.2 release went fairly smoothly, much smoother than the
last release!  We've gotten some great feedback (and had lots of bugs
filed) and of course have started working on Instantbird 1.3 already! 
Most of the fixes that have so far gone into the 1.3 nightlies so far
are minor...but taken altogether, I'm not sure I could go back to 1.2! 
Feel free to `give them a try <http://nightly.instantbird.im/>`__ and
`report any issues <https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/>`__ to us!

Thunderbird 15 was "recently" released, which also contained the core
chat backend of Instantbird.  We've had a bunch of bugs filed from that
release too!  Between feedback from the two programs we've made a lot of
minor improvements that will definitely make Instantbird (more of) a joy
to use.

Google Summer of Code 2012 has been over for a bit (it ended in August),
but we never thanked Will for his time with us and the great work he's
done so far.  Currently the `account
importer <http://www.tc.umn.edu/~nayes006/gsoc2012/index.php>`__ code he
wrote this summer is `undergoing
review <https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495>`__, but
hopefully it will be complete for Instantbird 1.3 to allow extremely
easy transitioning to Instantbird!  Thanks for a great summer Will!  We
hope you've enjoyed working with your mentor, Florian, and the rest of
the Instantbird team; we've definitely enjoyed working with you, helping
you and watching you learn.  Good luck and hopefully we'll continue to
see you around (and have contributions from you!) in the future.  We'd
also like to thanks Mozilla for graciously allowing us to be part of
Google Summer of Code 2012 through them!

As always, feel free to stop by #instantbird on irc.mozilla.org (and,
yes, Instantbird supports IRC: you can't use the excuse that you don't
have an IRC client!) to give us some feedback or ask questions.
