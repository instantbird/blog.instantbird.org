We have been contacted by lots of individuals who volunteered to
translate Instantbird into their native language and were eager to start
working on it. As we were not ready to host the translations, we asked
people to wait before starting their work on localized versions of
Instantbird.

As we plan to release the next beta of Instantbird 0.2 in several
languages, we feel that now is a good time to start translating the UI
of Instantbird. Please note that the development work is not finished
yet, and that there will still be string changes before we are ready to
release this next milestone.

You will find information on the translation process on our wiki at
http://wiki.instantbird.org/Instantbird:Translation. As usual, if you
have any question, feel free to ask them in #instantbird on
irc.mozilla.org or to contact us at contact AT instantbird DOT org.
