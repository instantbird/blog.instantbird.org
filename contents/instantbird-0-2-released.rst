After months of development and a few pre-release versions, we are happy
to announce that Instantbird 0.2 is now ready to be put in the hands of
the general public.

Instantbird 0.2 is now available in 5 languages thanks to the great work
of our translators.

If you have tried Instantbird 0.1 back in 2007 when it was first
released, Instantbird 0.2 may feel like a completely different software
to you. The most dramatically changed area is the conversation window
(for example, `new tabs <http://blog.instantbird.org/a18-tabs.html>`__
and `message
styles <http://blog.instantbird.org/a22-message-styles.html>`__), but
there are notable changes in almost every window. For a list of changes,
see the `release
notes <http://www.instantbird.com/release-notes.html>`__.

Let's stop talking, so that you can `discover Instantbird 0.2
now <http://www.instantbird.com/>`__!

In the next few days, we will talk about our plans for the future, and
especially Instantbird 0.3. Stay tuned!
